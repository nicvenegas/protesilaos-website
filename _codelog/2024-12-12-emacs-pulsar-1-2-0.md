This is a small package that temporarily highlights the current line
or region after a given function is invoked. Several user options
control the exact behaviour. [Watch the original demo](https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-03-14-emacs-pulsar-demo/).

This version refines an already stable base. Users do not need to make
any changes to their setup, unless they wish to try the new features.


## Automatically pulse the affected region

With the out-of-the-box settings, Pulsar temporarily highlights the
current line after any of the `pulsar-pulse-functions` is invoked and
`pulsar-mode` (or `pulsar-global-mode`) is enabled.

The new user option `pulsar-pulse-region-functions` makes Pulsar
temporarily highlight the affected region as well. For example, when
pasting some text into the buffer, it will highlight the portion of
text that was added.

The default value of `pulsar-pulse-region-functions` is nil, meaning
that no region pulsing is in effect (what we had before). Otherwise,
it is a list of functions. A typical use-case is the following:

```elisp
(setq pulsar-pulse-region-functions pulsar-pulse-region-common-functions)
```

This covers common commands, such as for copying and pasting a region
of text (restart `pulsar-mode` or `pulsar-global-mode` if needed).

Thanks to shipmints and Abdelhak Bougouffa for contributing the core
of this functionality. It was done in pull request 25:
<https://github.com/protesilaos/pulsar/pull/25>. Abdelhak's
contribution is within the ~15 line limit, meaning that no copyright
assignment to the Free Software Foundation is necessary, while
shipmints has already done the paperwork.

Relevant discussions took place in issues 10, 18, 21, and 22, as well
as pull request 24:

Thanks to Anwesh Gangula, Alex Kreisher, Diego Alvarez, and Ronny
Randen for their participation.

The region pulsing is inspired by Daniel Mendler's `goggles` package,
which itself is a take on a common theme covered by many other such
packages.


## Style region highlights differently

The following user options control the face of the `pulsar-pulse-region-functions`.

-   **`pulsar-region-face`:** Face to pulse a region that has not changed.
-   **`pulsar-region-change-face`:** Face to pulse a region that has changed (added or removed).

Pulsar defines several faces to get a nice style. Here is an example:

```elisp
(setq pulsar-region-face 'pulsar-green) ; unchanged regions are green
(setq pulsar-region-change-face 'pulsar-red) ; changed regions are red
```

## Pulse on window state change

An alternative to how Pulsar works out-of-the-box by reacting to the
`pulsar-pulse-functions` is to check for changes to the window layout.
Users who wish to have this behaviour can set the new user option
`pulsar-pulse-on-window-change` to a non-nil value.

As there may be overlap between the `pulsar-pulse-functions` and the
`pulsar-pulse-on-window-change`, users are advised to pick only one.
This is not a hard rule though: Pulsar will blithely highlight
everything if configured accordingly.

Thanks again to shipmints and Abdelhak Bougouffa for this
contribution. It is part of the aforementioned pull request 25.
