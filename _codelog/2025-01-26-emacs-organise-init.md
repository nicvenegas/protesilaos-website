In this 25-minute video I show two ways to organise your Emacs init.el
file. One approach is to keep editing the code in Emacs Lisp and to
leverage the "outline", while the other is to use a literate Org file
whose code blocks will be "tangled" to the init.el. I explain all the
technicalities and show examples. More resources:
