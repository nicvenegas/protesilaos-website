In this ~21-minute video I demonstrate the new optional extension for
Denote that I am developing. The 'denote-sequence.el' is part of the
'denote' package. Its purpose is to streamline the creation of
"sequence notes", i.e. files that have an inherent relationship
between them. The sequence is represented as a number.

Note that the code is in-development and will be released as part of
Denote version 3.2.0. I still plan to make some refinements, though
the core functionality is already done.

## About Denote

Denote is a simple note-taking tool for Emacs.  It is based on the idea
that notes should follow a predictable and descriptive file-naming
scheme.  The file name must offer a clear indication of what the note is
about, without reference to any other metadata.  Denote basically
streamlines the creation of such files while providing facilities to
link between them.

Denote's file-naming scheme is not limited to "notes".  It can be used
for all types of file, including those that are not editable in Emacs,
such as videos.  Naming files in a consistent way makes their
filtering and retrieval considerably easier.  Denote provides relevant
facilities to rename files, regardless of file type.
