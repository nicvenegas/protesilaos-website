This is a continuation of the previous thread about [Loneliness and
meaningful work](https://protesilaos.com/commentary/2025-01-03-re-loneliness-meaningful-work/).
I am publishing it separately because it stands on its own for the
most part.

The point of acceptance is not to choose which thoughts will occur
such as, for example, to only think positively, but to take what
happens for what it is, without judging it through the lens of
"should". If you are feeling a certain way, trying to force yourself
to feel differently in that moment will only make you suffer.

When we set goals, we do them with the recognition that they involve a
process of transformation. There is a change from state A to B,
typically with intermediate steps. This means that moment-by-moment we
are not at the goal and we may be making small steps laterally or even
backwards. Although the momentary experiences are happening despite
the longer-term plan, we still set ourselves up on the given path,
such that we persist on what we are doing. There are times when we can
push forward and others when we lack the resolve to do so. It then is
all about the bigger picture of what is happening, not just the micro
view of each moment in isolation.

Acceptance entails the recognition of our multifacetedness as a
species. We place disproportionate value to rationality, thinking that
it is somehow the superior faculty and the one to which every other
force "should" be subordinated to. Though we know that we have
emotions and needs of the body which cannot be reduced to rationality.
For example, we understand viscerally what an aesthetic experience is,
such as when we witness the awe of a sunset (which may not be with
every sunset): we cannot explain it in purely rational terms, except
by means of reduction. And "reduction" is exactly what the word
suggests: you are taking something away from it. Some aspects of the
world can only be felt.

Acceptance of multifacetedness, then, empowers us to be more lenient
with people and our self. Instead of expecting every action to be
purely rational, we understand that there is more to the human
experience. Our life cannot fit into neat dichotomies of right versus
wrong, except in specialised cases which are not generalisable. You
cannot, for instance, describe a storm in terms of good against evil,
but only as a fact which is. Thus, all the "should" and the "ought to"
are couched in terms of a certain tolerance for indeterminacy, else
nuance; tolerance of the subtleties of grey between the analytical
extremes of black and white, as it were.

Greeks have a saying since antiquity which loosely translates as
"there is no such thing as pure evil, for the world is one of
admixture where bad things still have something good to them". The
more faithful translation is "nothing bad not intermixed with good"
(«ουδέν κακόν αμιγές καλού»). The inverse is true, namely, there is
nothing purely good in our world. This is what nature teaches us
through all the moments in our life. It sets us up for an outlook that
is attuned to uncertainty.

The fact that you continue to worry about those predators that slither
in the shadows is natural. And this is the point of practicality: you
will think along those lines because such is your actuality. You will
never be in a state of pure thought where everything is resolved prior
to any action, such that no uncertainty remains. You cannot become
"pure thought" because you are a human, with flesh and bone, forced
into a world of action.

In this sense, what I suggest is to not argue against your nature, or
nature in general, but to go with its flow. You will go will the flow,
anyway, so better do it without kicking and screaming. There is a
certain lightness to this approach, for it does not burden you with
what essentially is an arbitrary commitment to be some impossible
non-human human (e.g. homo economicus).

These questions will persist and you will continue to recognise that
they will not be resolved. Uncertainty is burdensome only to the
extent that you try to address it as your sole preoccupation, only to
find you are not capable to do it. The burden then, qua burden, is the
flip-side of your powerlessness to this end.

It is neither gloomy nor blissful, but a state of "admixture", as the
Greeks see it. The "who I am" is dynamic. It is a process, with
recognisable patterns which, nevertheless, remains open-ended. Again,
uncertainty, nuance.

They will confront it. Those who are lucky enough will quickly realise
the futility of the endeavour and escape without suffering much
damage. The rest will keep digging a hole all the way into the depths
of the abyss where only depression awaits (writing from experience). I
recently published an article where I basically explain how the
further we probe into our own thoughts while disconnecting from the
here-and-now of our experience, the more miserable we are:
<https://protesilaos.com/commentary/2024-12-02-exploration-otherworldly-darkness/>.

A note here about free will, which I have not stressed, even if it is
implicit. My view of it is that we have "some control"---or at least
the inescapable impression of some control---but it is never complete
control. The video I did about the three fates (choice, chance,
inevitability) is consistent with this line of thinking:

This is fine. There is no need to apologise. We are trying to figure
things out as we go. This is yet another indication of how we are
always operating in a state of relative ignorance. I think what I
wrote above provides food for thought to what you are wrestling with
here. I am happy to elaborate on any point I made which you think is
unclear.
