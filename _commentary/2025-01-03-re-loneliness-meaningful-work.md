The way I understand loneliness, it is the feeling of alienation from
those around you. It is felt most strongly when you are around people,
because you are constantly reminded that you are not connected with
them. You may be collocated and have some superficial things in
common, but you otherwise do not feel you belong there. I was lonely
in Brussels while I was working in the field of politics (perhaps the
most people-oriented job is that of politicians and, by extension,
their assistants).

I decided to relocate to the mountains and leave that chapter of my
life behind me in large part as a response to loneliness. Things are
more quiet in the mountains and I am physically alone much of the time
(dogs notwithstanding), though I do not feel lonely. When I do meet
people, I sense that we are on good terms and things are going well.

Part of this change is due to the kind of people I find here. In
politics, you normally do not have any friends. Everything you share
about yourself can and will be used against you. The way I experienced
interpersonal affairs in that milieu is like you meet somebody who
gives you a passionate kiss, which makes you feel great, only to then
stab you in the back. It is an unsettling environment when you
actually care about connecting with people at a personal level (you
are connecting for political ends, which is different).

The people here are generally not caught up in this power dynamic.
They are thus more genuine. When a neighbour would share some
vegetables with me, for example, I knew they were authentic about
their offer and I was eager to do something for them as well. I helped
people train their dog or do some handy work around their house. It
was always a nice experience. I continue operating along those lines.

Another part of this is my own transformation as a person. I changed
my perspective about what I seek in others. I learnt that "meaningful"
is personal. For me, it covers a fairly small and highly specialised
number of topics such as technology, politics, and philosophy. So I
stopped expecting the average person to care about any of the things I
am interested in. I have instead learnt to listen to what they are
dealing with and keep an open mind about learning more along those
lines. There is a whole world out there and I am eager to be surprised
about matters that might eventually resonate with me.

You are describing me from when I was in my early 20s (now I am close
to 37 years old). I used to only expect deep exchanges and had trouble
keeping up with gossip or whatever other superficial issue. Until one
day I reflected on my outlook to conclude that I was being
self-centred, my expectations were misplaced, and my understanding of
casual chatter was one-sided (i.e. "wrong").

Why should every conversation be about something profound? People talk
about whatever they have on their mind for a number of reasons. One
among them is to be casual around you, which is a way for them to
gauge how comfortable about everyday stuff they can be in your midst.
I used to focus on the means (like gossip) rather than on the function
those were performing (socialising).

Rather than gossip being a boring thing that I personally had no
interest in, I recognised how it was a way for people to build trust
among themselves. I still had control over how I was contributing to
the discussion, such as by reminding the person that they should not
reach hasty conclusions. So I saw the positive side of my
participation in such experiences and now I am perfectly happy to
listen to gossip, even if I still do not care to initiate such an
exchange myself.

Much will depend on the people involved, though consider how you can
be the change you want to see. People will parrot whatever the trend
is in part because those who, like you, are interested in the finer
points do not share their perspective with patience and persistence. I
was like that as well. You do not change the world by complaining
about how it does not suit you. No. You do it, little by little,
through your deeds. This was the single most important realisation for
me, which fundamentally transformed me from a man of ideas to a man of
actions.

I think the "ideas" part has greatly benefited as a result. My
thoughts are now rooted in practicality. I do not get lost in thought
experiments and their conundra, thus overthinking and complicating
matters that are, in fact, simple.

When you operate along the lines of the doable, you also have a better
sense of what is likely to happen and what you can achieve under the
prevailing conditions (which makes you complain less to the point of
not complaining at all). Will I ever make everyone around me have the
same sensitivity to nuance that I do? Of course not and that is
probably for the better. Nature makes us all different because we have
highly diverse needs as a species. If everybody is a philosopher, for
example, we will not have engineers, nurses, singers, and so on. It
will be an incredibly harsh world.

Rather than refashion everyone in my imagine, I try to do my part as a
member of society. To put it simply, someone will have to be the
philosopher, so that others can be who they are. We all stand to gain
something if we acknowledge how diverse we are and how this is the
natural order. Instead of arguing with nature and judging its facts,
superimposing our biases to its realities, we learn to understand
phenomena without wishing for them to be something else. Only then can
we free ourselves from false wants and the troubling thoughts they
engender.

I have done a lot of manual labour, as well as the kind of
administrivia you describe (politics is full of it). I cannot think of
a job that has no "fluff work" at all or, anyhow, moments that are not
as rewarding as others. Even in construction you will have these
artificially important events where some manager wants to do something
for the sake of it in a manner that is arbitrary. I can even imagine
how it would have been had I become a professional footballer (soccer
player), where I would probably not enjoy the constant travelling to
play games or how commodified the sport is, but I would still like
football overall.

Again, there are many reasons why people behave the way they do. The
key is to focus on the essentials and not get disturbed by whatever
superficialities or necessary lower points. If you think those
meetings are a waste of time, try to be less invested in them. Also
challenge your bias against them by coming up with a concrete proposal
of how the work could be organised without them. If you have a
genuinely superior alternative, chances are your bosses will be
interested to learn about it (if it earns them money, anyway).
Similarly, if you think that some task you are doing has no meaning,
remind yourself that any job is a way to earn an income and not to
attain spiritual enlightenment. If you only care about "meaning", you
leave the industry and head to some monastery or whatnot.

I mentioned "action" earlier, so let me frame this point accordingly.
Your choices will help you in your introspection. If you choose to
work because you like the perks, then consider how this is something
you care about despite the downsides. If, on the other hand, you
cannot tolerate those downsides, then your next course of action must
be to switch careers. Complaining about the downsides will not
suffice. Would that improve your chances of finding meaning though?
Perhaps, though you will likely realise that what you are looking for
is not external: it comes from within. It has to do with your
perspective and expectations.

Here is the key part: the feeling that you "should" be doing something
else, which you imagine it to involve that which you fear about
loneliness and lack of sociability. You are, in other words, feeling
guilty.

Guilt can be a powerful impetus for change. If you truly believe that
what you are doing is wrong, then you have to focus your energy on
doing whatever it takes to not be guilty anymore. However, I get the
impression that what you are experiencing is a mismatch between your
lived and expected experiences. You pursue, for example, the
programming side project while telling yourself than you should be
doing something else instead. Is this, then, an expectation that you
can act on or a belief you have internalised and wish it to be true
but actually are not committed to? Try to take a step back and
consider what I wrote about earlier. It may help you figure out what
your next move will be.

To your final questions, no, I do not fear loneliness anymore because
I did what was necessary to escape from that world. I switched careers
and remade myself as a person. I now appreciate people the way they
are. As for faking it, no, I do not feel the need to behave in some
way that is not emanating from within. I am who I am and behave
honestly. People like you when you are authentic. Anything else will
make you look awkward---because you are awkward---which will unnerve
those around you.

This challenge you are facing is your opportunity to broaden your
horizons or, anyhow, to discover what you can do and what you actually
care about. When I went through this phase I became more open-minded
and also more humble in the immediate sense of discovering that nobody
is special (maybe one is special for a given task or in a certain
situation, but not holistically).

## Loss and anxiety

This is understandable. A breakup or generally a loss leaves a hole in
your heart. Especially if it involves a sense of betrayal, because
then you feel distrust towards others.

Consider though how it is not fair to use broad generalisations
against people. A loss of any sort is no reason to believe that
everybody is the same. If you have ever loved and have received love
(which you must have for you to even grow past the baby stage), you
know it can happen again. It will never be exactly what you already
lived through, because no moment can ever be relived. Be open to new
experiences and the rest will follow.

Social expectations are indeed at the heart of it. Though consider how
there is an internal dimension to them, namely, the fact that you have
internalised the expectations and are now measuring your
self/performance up to them. In this sense, "social" expectations
resolve to "personal" aspirations.

By framing it this way, you can start to work on them by asking the
simple question of "what happens if I fail to live up to their/my
standard?" In other words, what will society/you do to you if you are
not who they/you expect you to be? You will then find that in most
cases the answer is "nothing" or "nothing terrible", anyway.

This is especially true for cases such as the one we consider here:
fear of loneliness. Of course, there are cases where some tyranny will
force you to behave a certain way, such as some of the world's
theocratic regimes that deny women basic rights. You are not in this
position though. Try then to consider how bad can something
realistically be in your case for not living up to the standard.

There will always be those who will judge you a certain way. But there
is no escape from this reality. People talk and say things without
knowing the details of the case. They pass judgement while being
ignorant. You ultimately mind your business and express yourself the
way you like, not because it pleases others but only due to the inner
need it serves.

Social expectations may be social in origin, though we see how it
ultimately is our decision whether we subordinate ourselves to them or
not.

## Discovering that meaning is not static

If you are the inquisitive type, you will search for it yourself
anyway. Religion might help you frame things a certain way, but it
cannot undo your individuality and everything that comes with it. It
is indeed hard to accept that "my meaning" is meaningless to others,
because you care about it and would like to share it with people.

On the flip-side, because meaning comes from within, we know that we
can find new sources for it or outlets for its expression. As we grow
and learn more about the world, we discover our self better. If we
cling on to a specific interpretation of meaning, it is like holding
on to a distant memory hoping that it is recreated as a present
experience. It is thus liberating to internalise the notion that
meaning is not fixed.

I have lots of scattered references to the theme of free will. I have
been a free will sceptic myself, though I have recently changed my
approach.

Science and philosophy have always had these tentative hypotheses such
as "probability probably does not exist", "there is no free will",
"time is not fundamental", which, however, they cannot prove. My
thinking is that all these magnitudes exist until proven otherwise.
What such discussions do is put us in overthinking mode, for they are
not actionable, distracting us from the here-and-now which is always
practical, uncertain, and temporal.

The mind can reason about anything in isolation, such that it comes
down to the atom (in the original sense of "non-divisible", not the
misnomer of physics). In the process, it needs to reconcile how there
is something and what is the milieu it subsists in. If all is traced
back to some atom, then where are the laws of nature written? Does the
atom encode them? Does each atom do this? Alternatively, do the laws
of nature arise in the interplay of atoms? How did this interplay even
get triggered in the absence of prior laws and what where the
parameters of their initial cause?

Note that "God did it" does not answer the question, because you have
now simply decided that God is the initial condition, which then
continues the discussion of what is the state in which God exists,
what even brought about God, and so on.

We can come up with more questions and clever answers but are
ultimately tasked with living in the present of this world; a world of
admixture which for our purposes always is; a world where I cannot
avoid the impression that I am now choosing to write these words to
you and where even if I argue otherwise I still feel I made that
choice and you feel you were the intended recipient of it.

## Accepting uncertainty

This is my way of saying that I am okay with not answering all the
questions before I proceed. It goes back to your theme of fear. We are
afraid of what we do not know and try to resolve it before we proceed.
Though our temporal/physical reality is such that we cannot withdraw
into a world of theory where we have the luxury to figure everything
out before we make our next move.

To use a metaphor, I have accepted that there are dark corners around
me, which could be a vector of attack by some predator. Even though I
would like to explore them all before going to bed, I am too tired to
do so, as my energy is limited. No matter how much I try to shed light
to every corner, more of them are revealed, but my body can only stay
awake for so long. I eventually fall asleep, admitting that
uncertainty surrounds me and its resulting fear is an emotion I can
only ever accept and live with.
