title: "Interpretation of “The statue” by Yiannis Poulopoulos"
excerpt: "Translation of---and philosophical commentary on---a Greek song whose translated title is 'The statue'."
---

In this article, I interpet one of the most recognisable Greek songs of
all time. _The statue_ is among the many masterpieces performed by
Yiannis Poulopolos: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYVA0ztUlpw>.
Others include _Tonight I will drink the moon_ (Θα πιω απόψε το
φεγγάρι), _My dear neighbour_ (Γειτονάκι μου), _Beloved room_
(Καμαρούλα), and many others.

These songs occupy a central place in contemporary Greek culture, as
people of all ages have at one point or another listened to them. The
first time I remember paying attention to _The statue_ was in my
pre-teen years. At the time, I thought it was a nice song, but could
not appreciate its profoundity. This only happens with experience.
Here I am now, then, to expound on the meaning of this work of art.

Below are the original lyrics, followed by my translation and
commentary.

Το άγαλμα

Ερμηνεία:  Γιάννης Πουλόπουλος
Στίχοι:    Λευτέρης Παπαδόπουλος
Μουσική:   Μίμης Πλέσσας


Χθες μεσάνυχτα και κάτι κατηφόρισα
στην μικρή την πλατεΐτσα που σε γνώρισα
Κάποιο άγαλμα που μ'είδε με θυμήθηκε
και τον πόνο μου να ακούσει δεν αρνήθηκε

Και του μίλησα για σένα και για μένανε
και τα μάτια του βουρκώναν και όλο κλαίγανε
Του'πα για το φέρσιμο σου και για τα άλλα σου
τα ασυγχώρητα τα λάθη τα μεγάλα σου

Κι ύστερα με πιάσαν θεέ μου κάτι κλάματα
που με βρήκανε κουρέλι τα χαράματα
Με το άγαλμα ως το δρόμο προχωρήσαμε
μου εσκούπισε τα μάτια και χωρίσαμε
```

The statue

Singer:  Yiannis Poulopoulos
Lyrics:  Lefteris Papadopoulos
Music:   Memes Plessas


Yesterday past midnight I headed towards
the tiny cosy square where I made your acquaintance
A statue that saw me remember me
and did not refuse to listen to my pain

And I talked to it about you and me
and its eyes were tearful and would keep crying
I told it about your behaviour and the others
the unforgivable big mistakes of yours

And afterwards my god I cried heavily
that they found me in taters at dawn
With the statue we walked up to the street
it dried my eyes and we parted ways
```

The song is about those moments in a person's life when all they need
is to be heard. The statue is not a talkative figure. They are not
there to argue with the poetic "I", nor to pass judgement. Statues of
this sort provide an outlet for a deep seated feeling that needs to be
expressed without the fear of reprisal. The one who opens up to the
statue must feel safe in order to let it all out.

Unlike a therapist, the statue does not condition the person into the
role of a patient. Those who cry at tiny squares are not expecting to
be treated or to get some prescription on the immediate next steps.
No. The song's first person view presents us with a case of complex
emotions, encompassing frustration and disappointment, but also
determination and courage to keep going. Those who go through such a
moment are not in need of treatment per se. What they benefit from is
a reminder that the world does not end at the point of any given
hardship.

Statues are cold and distant, yet there is a certain depth, stability,
and authenticity to not exhibiting apparent compassion; to not being
over the top in reacting to someone's emotional state. These are the
kind of unassuming and trustworthy fellows who seemingly do not care
about the vicissitudes of life and who take it easy even in the face
of extraordinary circumstances. They are readily available for those
who need them. Their compassion is one that is felt, although not
necessarily advertised.

Consistent with the theme of not offering therapy, all statues do is
set the protagonist back on track. They will stop there though,
because it is up to the individual to proceed on their path. One's
burdens do not belong to another and it is a mistake to make such an
attempt. Statues may be robust, but they are not unbreakable.

Our protagonist shows fortitude and fearlessness in opening up to a
statue: to a form that may look fundamentally different from a human.
It is not though. There are some among us who are more statue-like in
their disposition. The song recognises as much, in that it has the
statue cry. Those people are no less human. They simply have a
different way of expressing our shared humanity. The poetic "I" has
learnt this lesson in the best possible way: by feeling it. Others may
understand as much through artistic representations. And---who
knows?---they too may encounter a statue when they need it, provided
they are open to such an experience.
