title: "Interpretation of “Letter” by Socratis Malamas"
excerpt: "Translation of---and philosophical commentary on---a song whose translated title is 'Letter'."

What follows is my interpretation of a song titled "To gramma" (The letter)
by Socratis Malamas (Σωκράτης Μάλαμας): <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_BiKXbz4bQ>.

First I provide the original lyrics, followed by my translation, and
then some comments:

```
Το γράμμα

Δε θέλω πια να σκέφτομαι τα ίδια και τα ίδια
Σα να'ταν όλα ψέμματα, στάχτες κι αποκαΐδια
Θέλω ανοιχτά παράθυρα να με χτυπάει αέρας
Να'χω το νου μου αδειανό
Να'χω και πρίμο τον καιρό

Δε θέλω πια να μου μιλάς για όσα έχεις ζήσει
Δε χάθηκε κι ο κόσμος πια το τζάμι αν ραγίσει
Θέλω να'ρθεις και να με βρεις να κάτσεις να τα πούμε
Πως νιώθουμε παράφορα
Πως ζούμε έτσι αδιάφορα

Δε θέλω να πικραίνεσαι
τις Κυριακές τα βράδια
Χωρίς αυτή τη σκοτεινιά
τα χρόνια μένουν άδεια

Θέλω να φύγεις να σωθείς να πάψεις να γκρινιάζεις
Να ξεχαστείς στη διαδρομή ποιος ήσουν και πώς μοιάζεις
Έτσι θα σ'αγαπώ πολύ και θα σε βλέπω λίγο
Σα μια γυναίκα μακρινή
Που αγάπησα πριν φύγω

Δε θέλω να πικραίνεσαι
τις Κυριακές τα βράδια
Χωρίς αυτή τη σκοτεινιά
τα χρόνια μένουν άδεια
```

```
To gramma (the letter)

I don't want to think the same over and over
As if they were all lies, ashes and embers
I want open windows to feel the breeze
To keep my mind empty
To also have the time as guide

I don't want you to tell me all you've been through
The world does not end even if the glass is cracked
I want you to come find me and sit for a chat
How do we feel passionately
How to we live so dispassionately

I don't want you to be saddened
on Sunday nights
Without this darkness
the years are left empty

I want you to leave to save yourself, to stop complaining
To become forgetful on the path about who you were and how you looked like
Thus I will love you a lot and see you a little
Like a distant woman
Whom I grew to love before leaving

I don't want you to be saddened
on Sunday nights
Without this darkness
the years are left empty
```

Socratis Malamas sings about a letter.  Who is the author and who its
intended recipient?  What does the author try to accomplish?  And which
are the recipient's woes?  I believe this is a monologue.  The person is
trying to escape from their own obsessions, to let go of the past, and
to accept the present for what it is.

[ Read/watch: [On learning and being present](https://protesilaos.com/books/2022-06-25-knowledge-presence/) ]

In the opening verse, Malamas, speaks in the first person.  All those
bothersome thoughts that keep playing in a loop need to be rendered
irrelevant.  They must be treated as lies, or, better, as ashes and
embers---a metaphor pointing to their transient nature.  Embers die out
as the fire subsides: so must the long-obsolete mental burdens we carry
around.

Malamas then addresses the self as a "you".  The "I" has already broken
free from the shackles, while the "you" represents the part that clings
on to the past.  This "you" continues to rave about what has transpired
and what they have lived through.  Central in those moments is a certain
sense of failure, represented by the cracked glass.  There is no undoing
such irreparable damage.  The "you" regrets that moment and their guilt
makes them suffer.  This is why the "I" wants to empty the mind: to put
an end to all those scenaria, all the what-could-have-been.  They do not
exist.

The comparison between passionate feelings and dispassionate living is
not a contradiction.  Both are consistent with the idea that we keep our
undivided attention in the moment.  When you utter "I love you", the
emotion pertains to the here-and-now, to the exact experience.  Not the
ambitions, not the longer-term plans, not the "what will others say
about it", and certainly not in relation to what your past self could
have done.  What occurs, what is in the present, is the feeling, which
is passionate.  When we live moment-by-moment we do it with aloofness,
for we are not fastened upon constructs of either the past or the
future.  We have already cleared the room, freed the mind from such
concerns.  Experiences can then be savoured in full.

What about those "Sunday nights" that bring sorrow?  Why are the years
left empty without their darkness?  I think emptiness is at the root of
the sense of dread and helplessness we feel once we recognise the
disconnect between our actuality and the figments of our imagination.
In other words, we accept moments of loneliness for what they are,
without dwelling on the fact of our loneliness---it is what it is.
Insisting on the "what if" and the "have to" contradicts the reality: it
builds up tension, engenders [incentives to be someone
else](https://protesilaos.com/interpretations/2022-06-28-alkinoos-mirror/),
sets up insurmountable obstacles, and makes us feel worthless as we
[move to the sidelines](https://protesilaos.com/interpretations/2022-06-28-trypes-train/).
Hence the sense of feeling lost which brings sadness.  To those who are
ever-present, darkness simply is; years are not left empty.

Do yourself a favour and venture on the path, forgetting who you once
were and how you used to look---none of those considerations matter.

Which brings me to this wonderful reference to the "distant woman whom I
grew to love before leaving".  We can only expect this emotion to have
been genuine: a passionate feeling, as I already noted.  Yet the person
did not latch on to it: they left.  Why leave behind someone you love?
That is not the point.  The real issue here is whether you accept the
fact that when conditions are such, you must move on, else you develop
obsessions about a state of affairs that has ceased to be.  The memory
remains, yet the woman is distant because one learns to remain aloof
from the fray and not give in to superficially sweet delusions.

Let me then comment on the legend of Laodamia.  This was a young woman
who married Iolaos, the prince of a small community in Thessaly
(modern-day central Greece).  The couple were in love.  Iolaos had to
join the Trojan War on the side of the Achaeans.  Such are the duties of
a prince.  As the soothsayers had foretold, the first to set foot on
Troy would die on the spot.  None of the leading figures dared to
venture forth.  Iolaos took the initiative to break the standstill.  And
died...  History records this act as one of selflessness: Iolaos was
posthumously renamed to "Protesilaos", the "first of the people".  Back
at home, Laodamia could not live with news of Iolaos' death: she loved
the man, not the symbol made out of him.  Symbols persist, but the man
was dead.  Laodamia thus created a simulacrum of her husband and
dedicated her life to it.  She could not move on; she could not accept
that Iolaos had become "distant", to re-use Malamas' lyrics.  Laodamias'
father lit a fire to dismantle the effigy, in hope that his daughter
would come to terms with reality.  To his surprise, Laodamia jumped into
the flames and burned to death.

While we can interpret the story as one of eternal love, I hold that
would do us a disservice.  There is no denying how Laodamia felt about
Iolaos.  Her love was sincere.  The gist is that she anchored her life
in the past, in an imaginary world that would never correspond with her
actuality.  It is not the fire that killed her, but the powerful
delusions that denied her the experience of the present.  She was dead
inside.  The rest was a formality.

The "distant woman whom I grew to love before leaving" is neither
limited to love nor to a certain woman.  It hints at our resilience, at
the lightness which characterises our conduct, when we have mastered how
to let go.
