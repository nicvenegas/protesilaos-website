<p>
This version changes the underlying implementation of Fontaine's font
configuration presets. In principle, this should not have any effect
on how users experience the package, though there are some important
details that are different.
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-h:6d051d64-2623-4877-935f-4792579888a3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="h:6d051d64-2623-4877-935f-4792579888a3">Fontaine is now a "theme"</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:6d051d64-2623-4877-935f-4792579888a3">
<p>
Fontaine has always modified typography-related faces, such as
<code>default</code>, <code>fixed-pitch</code>, and <code>variable-pitch</code>, to apply the font
family, height, and weight specified by the user. In the past, this
was done in a way that could get overridden under certain conditions,
such as by loading a theme after setting a Fontaine preset configuration.
</p>

<p>
By making Fontaine a theme, we guarantee that its settings are not
undone. In practice, this means that users do not have to re-apply the
current preset after loading a theme. The function <code>fontaine-apply-current-preset</code>
is thus obsolete.
</p>

<p>
In Emacs, a "theme" is a bundle of configurations. Those typically
cover colours (such as with my <code>modus-themes</code>), but a theme can focus
on other settings as well. For example, the popular <code>use-package</code> is
internally done as a theme (check the value of <code>custom-known-themes</code>).
</p>

<p>
Fontaine is a theme in the same way <code>use-package</code> is, meaning that it
will (i) persist its effects, (ii) not show up in the
<code>custom-enabled-themes</code> and so not be affected by something like
<code>(mapc #'disable-theme custom-enabled-themes)</code>,
and (iii) not be an option among those presented by <code>load-theme</code>.
</p>

<p>
There are no known bugs, though please contact me if you encounter a
scenario where Fontaine does not do the right thing. Thanks, in this
regard, to Haruko and Emily Hyland for reporting a couple of bugs:

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:01648e81-6499-41ef-b200-b6784cbf4c96">
<p>
In the past, users could apply a Fontaine preset to the current frame
without affecting other frames. While this could be useful in certain
situations, it was ultimately making the code more complex for
marginal gains. As part of the transition to a theme, which is anyway
global, I am removing everything related to frame-specific functionality.

<li>The <code>fontaine-generic-face-families</code> are used when necessary to
guard against <code>nil</code> values. Those font families are symbolic
references to whatever the operating system is configured to use
(e.g. on Linux this is handled by fontconfig).</li>

<li>If Fontaine is instructed to load an invalid preset, it displays a
warning and does nothing else. Before, it would produce an error,
which could prevent Emacs from starting up normally if this were to
happen at startup. A warning is enough to inform the user of what is
happening.</li>

<li>Same principle as above when Emacs is not ran in a graphical
interface. In text terminals, Fontaine cannot work because it is not
possible to have different font families, styles, and heights, than
those of the terminal (hence the backronym of FONTAINE "Fonts,
Ornaments, and Neat Typography Are Irrelevant in Non-graphical
Emacs"). Thanks to Jorge Gomez for the patch in pull request 13:

relevant history).</li>

<p>
Fontaine is in a stable state and I find it very useful every day.
This release includes some small quality-of-life improvements.

<h3 id="h:ffcb3442-3f5e-4bfb-bbf6-8de6c54f1c1e">Use the <code>fontaine-toggle-preset</code> command</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:ffcb3442-3f5e-4bfb-bbf6-8de6c54f1c1e">
<p>
It will switch between the last preset and the one you are currently
using. If it cannot find an older preset, it will prompt for one using
minibuffer completion.
</p>

<p>
Presets are set with the <code>fontaine-set-preset</code> command, either
interactively or from Lisp (e.g. in the <code>init.el</code> file).
</p>

<p>
Internally, <code>fontaine-toggle-preset</code> takes care to only switch between
existing presets, so old preset names (such as from the time of some
experiment) will be skipped if they are not part of the current value
of <code>fontaine-presets</code>.
</p>

<h3 id="h:bf1c4be7-9366-4ce2-a166-ae43e0bce833">All entries in the <code>fontaine-presets</code> accept and optional width attribute</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:bf1c4be7-9366-4ce2-a166-ae43e0bce833">
<p>
This is for users who need to set an explicit width value to the
underlying face they are targeting. This, of course, depends on the
capabilities of the font family that is used. Those that do not
support varying widths will have no effect.
</p>

<p>
The width attribute for all existing entries is composed by the name
of the face plus the <code>-width</code> suffix, such as <code>:fixed-pitch-width</code>.
Check the Fontaine manual for a complete example.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to Adam Porter for making the suggestion to cover the width
attribute in issue 6: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/fontaine/issues/6">https://github.com/protesilaos/fontaine/issues/6</a>.
</p>

<p>
The <code>fontaine-presets</code> can look very long if all values are set, as we
cover all typography-related faces and all their attributes. But do
not let this intimidate you. Your configuration can be short and still
highly usable. For example:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(setq fontaine-presets
      '((coding ; get the fallback values and override the `:default-height'
         :default-height 120)
        (reading  ; change more stuff from the fallback values
         :default-height 140
         :default-family "Fira Sans"
         :fixed-pitch-family "Fira Mono"
         :variable-pitch-family "Merriweather")
        (presentation
         :inherit reading ; copy the attributes of `reading', then override the `:default-height'
         :default-height 220)
        (t ; everything falls back to this
         :default-family "Iosevka Comfy"
         :default-height 100
         :fixed-pitch-family "Iosevka Comfy Motion"
         :variable-pitch-family "Iosevka Comfy Duo")))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
With these, you can switch between <code>coding</code>, <code>reading</code>, and
<code>presentation</code> to match your evolving workflow requirements.
</p>

<p>
These allow you to switch between not only different font families,
but also font combinations to match a certain style, with higher or
lower heights, and so on.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-h:4216d32e-22a9-4d17-8b05-5191a93a5ec8" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="h:4216d32e-22a9-4d17-8b05-5191a93a5ec8">The <code>fontaine-set-preset</code> prompt only uses relevant default presets</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:4216d32e-22a9-4d17-8b05-5191a93a5ec8">
<p>
When you invoke the command <code>fontaine-set-preset</code> it tries to find a
previous preset to set it as the default minibuffer value. This means
that if you press <code>RET</code> without selecting anything, the default will
be used (check with your minibuffer package in case this does not
happen, or contact me if you need help).
</p>

<p>
Before, the default value was the last selected preset. This could be
out-of-date though if the <code>fontaine-presets</code> were rewritten in the
meantime. Now we take care to only produce a default value that is
among those specified in the <code>fontaine-presets</code>.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:44697327-628b-4515-a672-4547bef81a43">
<p>
This version brings a major expansion to the scope of the user option
<code>fontaine-presets</code>. It can now control the font family and concomitant
attributes of more Emacs faces. In particular, it covers the following
additional faces:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>mode-line-active</code> and <code>mode-line-inactive</code>.</li>
<li><code>header-line</code>.</li>
<li><code>line-number</code> (from the <code>display-line-numbers-mode</code> or its global variant).</li>
<li><code>tab-bar</code> (from the <code>tab-bar-mode</code>).</li>
<li><code>tab-line</code> (from the <code>tab-line-mode</code>).</li>
</ul>

<p>
All the supported faces are stored as the value of the variable
<code>fontaine-faces</code>. This is the complete list:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>default</code></li>
<li><code>fixed-pitch</code></li>
<li><code>fixed-pitch-serif</code></li>
<li><code>variable-pitch</code></li>
<li><code>mode-line-active</code></li>
<li><code>mode-line-inactive</code></li>
<li><code>line-number</code></li>
<li><code>tab-bar</code></li>
<li><code>tab-line</code></li>
<li><code>bold</code></li>
<li><code>italic</code></li>
</ul>

<p>
Existing users do not need to update their configuration, as (i) the old
values will still work and (ii) undefined values fall back to reliable
known values.
</p>

<p>
This change empowers users to further configure their setup, such as:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Make the mode lines smaller than the main text.</li>
<li>Use a proportionately spaced font for the tabs, while retaining a
monospaced font for editing.</li>
<li>Use a different font family for line numbers to differentiate them
from the main body of text.</li>
</ul>

<p>
These are some possibilities. Then consider that different presets can
change specify different configurations. For example, a <code>coding</code>
preset can be all about small, monospaced fonts, while a <code>reading</code>
preset may increase the font sizes and apply proportionately spaced
fonts.
</p>

<p>
The doc string of <code>fontaine-presets</code> covers the technicalities, as
does the official manual (shipped with the package or available on my
website: <a href="https://protesilaos.com/emacs/fontaine">https://protesilaos.com/emacs/fontaine</a>).
</p>

<p>
Thanks to Ashlin Eldridge for suggesting the inclusion of mode line
and line number faces. This was done in issue 4:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/fontaine/issues/4">https://github.com/protesilaos/fontaine/issues/4</a>.

<h3 id="h:a016aa76-29b4-487c-afef-90f7db61d5d0">Use the <code>fontaine-mode</code> to persist presets</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:a016aa76-29b4-487c-afef-90f7db61d5d0">
<p>
The new <code>fontaine-mode</code> provides a convenience toggle to do the
following:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Store the current Fontaine preset before closing Emacs.</li>
<li>Store the latest preset after using the command <code>fontaine-set-preset</code>.</li>
<li>Persist font configurations while changing themes.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The purpose of storing the latest preset is to restore it easily, such
as when starting Emacs. In the manual, we mention this in the sample
configuration:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">;; Set the last preset or fall back to desired style from `fontaine-presets'
;; (the `regular' in this case).
(fontaine-set-preset (or (fontaine-restore-latest-preset) 'regular))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This takes effect while starting up Emacs. So if, say, the user had
selected a <code>reading</code> preset with <code>fontaine-set-preset</code> and then closed
Emacs while <code>fontaine-mode</code> was enabled, the <code>reading</code> preset will be
restored on startup.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to Adam Porter (alphapapa) for suggesting this in issue 2:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/fontaine/issues/2">https://github.com/protesilaos/fontaine/issues/2</a>.
</p>

<p>
We used to provide code in the sample configuration which was doing
what <code>fontaine-mode</code> does, though this is easier to set up (plus it is
a toggle).

<p>
This command was used to interactively set the attributes of a face.
It was not consistent with the rest of Fontaine's functionality, plus
it was not faster than setting face attributes directly from Lisp
(such as to test them, while experimenting in the <code>*scratch*</code> buffer).

<p>
The functions added to this hook are called after <code>fontaine-set-preset</code>.
For example, users of my <code>pulsar</code> package can highlight the current
line to not lose track of the cursor:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(add-hook 'fontaine-set-preset-hook #'pulsar-pulse-line)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
I had thought about defining what Emacs terms "abnormal hooks", which
are hooks that pass arguments to their functions. This hook would pass
the selected preset, but I ultimately opted for the normal hook that
run their functions without arguments. If advanced users have a good
reason for such a feature, they are welcome to discuss it with me.

<p>
Fontaine has been in a stable state for several months now.  I am thus
increasing the major version number to reflect this fact.  Otherwise,
this is a small release with only one sizeable addition.
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-h:f842797f-5b46-40e4-adc3-e98b289d85bf" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="h:f842797f-5b46-40e4-adc3-e98b289d85bf">Inherit the properties of another named preset</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:f842797f-5b46-40e4-adc3-e98b289d85bf">
<p>
Preset font configuration can now optionally inherit (and thus extend)
the properties of another named preset.
</p>

<p>
When defining multiple presets, we may need to duplicate properties
and then make tweaks to individual values.  Suppose we want to have
two distinct presets for presentations: one is for coding related
demonstrations and the other for prose.  Both must have some common
styles, but must define distinct font families each of which is
suitable for the given task.  In this case, we do not want to fall
back to the generic <code>t</code> preset (per the default behaviour) and we also
do not wish to duplicate properties manually, potentially making
mistakes in the process.  Fontaine thus provides a method of
inheriting a named preset's properties by using the <code>:inherit</code>
property with a value that references the name of another preset
(technically, the <code>car</code> of that list).  Here is the idea:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(setq fontaine-presets
      '((regular
         :default-height 100)
        (code-demo
         :default-family "Source Code Pro"
         :default-weight semilight
         :default-height 170
         :variable-pitch-family "Sans"
         :bold-weight extrabold)
        (prose-demo
         :inherit code-demo ; copy the `code-demo' properties
         :default-family "Sans"
         :variable-pitch-family "Serif"
         :default-height 220)
        (t
         :default-family "Monospace"
         ;; more generic fallback properties here...
         )))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
In this scenario, the <code>regular</code> preset gets all its properties from
the <code>t</code> preset.  We omit them here in the interest of brevity (see the
default value of <code>fontaine-presets</code> and its documentation for the
details).  In turn, the <code>code-demo</code> specifies more properties and
falls back to <code>t</code> for any property not explicitly referenced therein.
Finally, the <code>prose-demo</code> copies everything in <code>code-demo</code>, overrides
every property it specifies, and falls back to <code>t</code> for every other
property.
</p>

<p>
In the interest of simplicity, Fontaine does not support recursive
inheritance.  If there is a compelling need for it, we can add it in
future versions.

<li>Fixed a faulty setup for the <code>:height</code> attribute of the <code>bold</code> face.
Using the commands <code>fontaine-set-preset</code> or <code>fontaine-set-face-font</code>
with a prefix argument (<code>C-u</code> with default key bindings) does not
produce an error anymore.  The prefix argument limits the operation
to the current frame.</li>

<li>Updated the <code>Commentary</code> section of <code>fontaine.el</code> to use the
FONTAINE backronym I have had on my website for a long time.
Namely, I changed <code>FONTs Are Irrelevant in Non-graphical Emacs</code>,
which was cheating on a few letters, to <code>Fonts, Ornaments, and Neat
  Typography Are Irrelevant in Non-graphical Emacs</code>.  What do you mean
this is not a bug fix? 🙃</li>

Made it possible for the user option <code>fontaine-presets</code> to cover the
<code>fixed-pitch-serif</code> face.  This face is used by the default Emacs
faces in Info buffers to render inline code elements.  A list of
properties within <code>fontaine-presets</code> can thus look like this (the
manual explains everything in detail&#x2014;else check my current setup at
the end of this entry):
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">  (regular
   ;; I keep all properties for didactic purposes, but most can be
   ;; omitted.
   :default-family "Monospace"
   :default-weight regular
   :default-height 100
   :fixed-pitch-family nil ; falls back to :default-family
   :fixed-pitch-weight nil ; falls back to :default-weight
   :fixed-pitch-height 1.0
   :fixed-pitch-serif-family nil ; falls back to :default-family
   :fixed-pitch-serif-weight nil ; falls back to :default-weight
   :fixed-pitch-serif-height 1.0
   :variable-pitch-family "Sans"
   :variable-pitch-weight nil
   :variable-pitch-height 1.0
   :bold-family nil ; use whatever the underlying face has
   :bold-weight bold
   :italic-family nil
   :italic-slant italic
   :line-spacing nil)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
When the relevant attributes of <code>fixed-pitch-serif</code> are not specified,
they fall back to the values of the <code>default</code> face.
</p>

<p>
Note that <code>fixed-pitch-serif</code> is not used by my <code>modus-themes</code> and
<code>ef-themes</code> because I think it looks awful out-of-the-box (a bitmap
font on the GNU/Linux distros I used).  One can still modify any face
to inherit from <code>fixed-pitch-serif</code>, if they want to.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Introduced the command <code>fontaine-apply-current-preset</code> and wrote a
relevant entry in the manual on how to "Persist font configurations on
theme switch".  Relevant quote from the manual:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Themes re-apply face definitions when they are loaded.  This is
necessary to render the theme.  For certain faces, such as <code>bold</code> and
<code>italic</code>, it means that their font family may be reset (depending on the
particularities of the theme).
</p>

<p>
To avoid such a problem, we can arrange to restore the current font
preset which was applied by <code>fontaine-set-preset</code>.  Fontaine provides
the command <code>fontaine-apply-current-preset</code>.  It can either be called
interactively after loading a theme or be assigned to a hook that is ran
at the post <code>load-theme</code> phase.
</p>

<p>
Some themes that provide a hook are the <code>modus-themes</code> and <code>ef-themes</code>
(both by Protesilaos), so we can use something like: [&#x2026;]
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li>The once private variable <code>fontaine--current-preset</code> is now made
public by means of a rename to <code>fontaine-current-preset</code>.  In
practical terms, this tells advanced users that they can rely on the
presence of this variable and/or on the fact that changes to it will
be documented accordingly.</li>

you some ideas:

This is a stability release that introduces minor tweaks while
formalising point releases which were already available to users.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Fixed a bug where a nil minibuffer history would produce an error
while trying to set a preset.</li>

<li>Required the <code>subr-x</code> library at compile time.  This is to avoid
scenaria where <code>if-let</code> and friends are not known to the byte
compiler.  Such a problem was reported by Ted Reed concerning their
Emacs 27 build:
<a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/fontaine/%3Cm27d6t3f7a.fsf@zenithia.net%3E#%3C87ee11w1j0.fsf@zenithia.net%3E">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/fontaine/%3Cm27d6t3f7a.fsf@zenithia.net%3E#%3C87ee11w1j0.fsf@zenithia.net%3E</a>.</li>

<li>Simplified the text of the minibuffer prompt for the <code>default</code> face.
The <code>marginalia</code> package treats the candidates as faces when the word
"face" occurs in the prompt.  Generally that should be okay, though we
do not want it in our case.</li>

<li>Documented a reference to the "devel" variant of GNU ELPA.  This is
for users who want to use a version of the package built from the
latest commit instead of the last tagged release.  Read:
<a href="https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-05-13-emacs-elpa-devel/">https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-05-13-emacs-elpa-devel/</a>.</li>

<li>Refrained from erroring out with <code>fontaine-set-preset</code> if Emacs is not
in a graphical window (GUI) while the <code>emacs --daemon</code> is in use.  The
<code>user-error</code> is now limited to the case where a standalone frame is
non-graphial and the daemon is not running (the error is that you
cannot change fonts inside of TUI Emacs).  Thanks to Florent Teissier
for the patch!</li>

<li>Named the mailing list address as the <code>Maintainer:</code> of Denote.
Together with the other package headers, they help the user find our
primary sources and/or communication channels.  This change conforms
with work being done upstream in package.el by Philip Kaludercic.  I
was informed about it here:
<a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/general-issues/%3C875ykl84yi.fsf%40posteo.net%3E">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/general-issues/%3C875ykl84yi.fsf%40posteo.net%3E</a>.</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Fontaine can apply its changes on a per-frame basis.  One frame may,
for example, use a preset of font configurations for the purposes of a
"presentation" while the other has a "small" setup.  Concretely,
invoke the commands <code>fontaine-set-preset</code> and <code>fontaine-set-face-font</code>
with a universal prefix argument (<code>C-u</code>).  Without a prefix argument,
these commands apply to all frames (as it was before).</li>

<li>The <code>fontaine-presets</code> accepts a special <code>t</code> preset which provides
"shared fallback values" for all presets.  The manual has a section
titled "Shared and implicit fallback values for presets" which covers
all permutations of <code>fontaine-presets</code> at length.  The gist is that
the user can write more concise presets.  Thanks to Ted Reed for
proposing the idea and testing my prototype in the mailing list:
<a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/fontaine/%3C87y1zcmo67.fsf@zenithia.net%3E">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/fontaine/%3C87y1zcmo67.fsf@zenithia.net%3E</a>.</li>

<li>Simplified the sample configuration on how to restore the latest saved
value or fall back to a preferred preset.  Thanks to Christopher
League for proposing an elegant expression over at the mailing list:
<a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/fontaine/%3C87sfpop0dm.fsf@contrapunctus.net%3E#%3C87pmksoyv6.fsf@contrapunctus.net%3E">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/fontaine/%3C87sfpop0dm.fsf@contrapunctus.net%3E#%3C87pmksoyv6.fsf@contrapunctus.net%3E</a></li>

<li>The <code>fontaine-latest-state-file</code> is now handled by the package
<code>no-littering</code>.  Thanks to Christopher League for adding it there:
<a href="https://github.com/emacscollective/no-littering/commit/76b7335202a5b6ddc6b6798a2e2fd5b09df57dc2">https://github.com/emacscollective/no-littering/commit/76b7335202a5b6ddc6b6798a2e2fd5b09df57dc2</a></li>

<li>The new user option <code>fontaine-font-families</code> specifies the preferred
font families that are provided as completion candidates of the
command <code>fontaine-set-face-font</code>.  If left to its default nil value,
Fontaine tries to find relevant fonts from the underlying system,
though this is not always accurate depending on the build of Emacs and
where it runs in.</li>

<li>The doc string of <code>fontaine-presets</code> mentions some important caveats
or information about font settings in emacs.  Thanks to Eli Zaretskii
for the feedback on the emacs-devel mailing list:
<a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2022-04/msg01281.html">https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2022-04/msg01281.html</a>.</li>

Initial release of the package.  Please read the manual.

<p>
The core idea for this package was implemented in the <code>prot-fonts.el</code>
file that is part of <a href="https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles">my dotfiles</a> (now deprecated).  I was using it at
least since November 2020, though the underlying code was probably
implemented at an earlier date.
