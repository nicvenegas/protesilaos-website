<p>
Denote aims to be a simple-to-use, focused-in-scope, and effective
note-taking and file-naming tool for Emacs.
</p>

<p>
Denote is based on the idea that files should follow a predictable and
descriptive file-naming scheme.  The file name must offer a clear
indication of what the contents are about, without reference to any
other metadata.  Denote basically streamlines the creation of such
files or file names while providing facilities to link between them
(where those files are editable).
</p>

<p>
Denote&rsquo;s file-naming scheme is not limited to &ldquo;notes&rdquo;.  It can be used
for all types of file, including those that are not editable in Emacs,
such as videos.  Naming files in a consistent way makes their
filtering and retrieval considerably easier.  Denote provides relevant
facilities to rename files, regardless of file type.
</p>

<p>
Denote is based on the following core design principles:
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Predictability</dt><dd>File names must follow a consistent and descriptive
naming convention (<a href="#h:4e9c7512-84dc-4dfb-9fa9-e15d51178e5d">The file-naming scheme</a>).  The file name alone
should offer a clear indication of what the contents are, without
reference to any other metadatum.  This convention is not specific to
note-taking, as it is pertinent to any form of file that is part of
the user&rsquo;s long-term storage (<a href="#h:532e8e2a-9b7d-41c0-8f4b-3c5cbb7d4dca">Renaming files</a>).</dd>

<dt>Composability</dt><dd>Be a good Emacs citizen, by integrating with other
packages or built-in functionality instead of re-inventing functions
such as for filtering or greping.  The author of Denote (Protesilaos,
aka &ldquo;Prot&rdquo;) writes ordinary notes in plain text (<code>.txt</code>), switching on
demand to an Org file only when its expanded set of functionality is
required for the task at hand (<a href="#h:17896c8c-d97a-4faa-abf6-31df99746ca6">Points of entry</a>).</dd>

<dt>Portability</dt><dd>Notes are plain text and should remain portable.  The
way Denote writes file names, the front matter it includes in the
note&rsquo;s header, and the links it establishes must all be adequately
usable with standard Unix tools.  No need for a database or some
specialised software.  As Denote develops and this manual is fully
fleshed out, there will be concrete examples on how to do the
Denote-equivalent on the command-line.</dd>

<dt>Flexibility</dt><dd>Do not assume the user&rsquo;s preference for a note-taking
methodology.  Denote is conceptually similar to the Zettelkasten
Method, which you can learn more about in this detailed introduction:
<a href="https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/">https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/</a>.  Notes are atomic (one file
per note) and have a unique identifier.  However, Denote does not
enforce a particular methodology for knowledge management, such as a
restricted vocabulary or mutually exclusive sets of keywords.  Denote
also does not check if the user writes thematically atomic notes.  It
is up to the user to apply the requisite rigor and/or creativity in
pursuit of their preferred workflow (<a href="#h:6060a7e6-f179-4d42-a9de-a9968aaebecc">Writing metanotes</a>).</dd>

<dt>Hackability</dt><dd>Denote&rsquo;s code base consists of small and reusable
functions.  They all have documentation strings.  The idea is to make
it easier for users of varying levels of expertise to understand what
is going on and make surgical interventions where necessary (e.g. to
tweak some formatting).  In this manual, we provide concrete examples
on such user-level configurations (<a href="#h:4a6d92dd-19eb-4fcc-a7b5-05ce04da3a92">Keep a journal or diary</a>).</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Now the important part&#x2026;  &ldquo;Denote&rdquo; is the familiar word, though it also
is a play on the &ldquo;note&rdquo; concept.  Plus, we can come up with acronyms,
recursive or otherwise, of increasingly dubious utility like:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Don&rsquo;t Ever Note Only The Epiphenomenal</li>
<li>Denote Everything Neatly; Omit The Excesses</li>
</ul>

<p>
But we&rsquo;ll let you get back to work.  Don&rsquo;t Eschew or Neglect your
Obligations, Tasks, and Engagements.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-h:17896c8c-d97a-4faa-abf6-31df99746ca6">
<p>
There are seven main ways to write a note with Denote: invoke the
<code>denote</code>, <code>denote-type</code>, <code>denote-date</code>, <code>denote-subdirectory</code>,
<code>denote-template</code>, <code>denote-signature</code> commands, or leverage the
<code>org-capture-templates</code> by setting up a template which calls the
function <code>denote-org-capture</code>.  We explain all of those in the
subsequent sections.  Other more specialised commands exist as well,
which one shall learn about as they read through this manual.  We do
not want to overwhelm the user with options at this stage.
</p>

<p>
All these commands construct the file name in accordance with the user option
<code>denote-file-name-components-order</code> (<a href="#h:dc8c40e0-233a-4991-9ad3-2cf5f05ef1cd">Change the order of file name components</a>).
</p>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:6a92a8b5-d766-42cc-8e5b-8dc255466a23">
<p>
The <code>denote</code> command will prompt for a title.  If a region is active,
the text of the region becomes the default at the minibuffer prompt
(meaning that typing <code>RET</code> without any input will use the default
value).  Once the title is supplied, the <code>denote</code> command will then ask
for keywords.  The resulting note will have a file name as already
explained: <a href="#h:4e9c7512-84dc-4dfb-9fa9-e15d51178e5d">The file naming scheme</a>
</p>

<p>
The <code>denote</code> command runs the hook <code>denote-after-new-note-hook</code> after
creating the new note. When called from Lisp, it returns the path it
generates. Before returning the path, it decides what to do with the
buffer of the note, in accordance with the user option
<code>denote-kill-buffers</code> (<a href="#h:c8fd826f-3ac9-4820-9709-4375603f8865">The <code>denote-kill-buffers</code> option</a>). [ As part of
3.2.0-dev, the <code>denote</code> command runs the hook and then
kills the buffer, whereas it was the other way around before. ]
</p>

<p>
The file type of the new note is determined by the user option
<code>denote-file-type</code> (<a href="#h:13218826-56a5-482a-9b91-5b6de4f14261">Front matter</a>).
</p>

<p>
The keywords&rsquo; prompt supports minibuffer completion.  Available
candidates are those defined in the user option <code>denote-known-keywords</code>.
More candidates can be inferred from the names of existing notes, by
setting <code>denote-infer-keywords</code> to non-nil (which is the case by
default) (<a href="#h:c0fb477f-4f99-4d76-9cce-132bcfcb351d">Create a controlled vocabulary for keywords</a>).
</p>

<p>
Multiple keywords can be inserted by separating them with a comma (or
whatever the value of the <code>crm-separator</code> is&#x2014;which should be a comma).
When the user option <code>denote-sort-keywords</code> is non-nil (the default),
keywords are sorted alphabetically (technically, the sorting is done
with <code>string-lessp</code>).
</p>

<p>
The interactive behaviour of the <code>denote</code> command is influenced by the
user option <code>denote-prompts</code> (<a href="#h:f9204f1f-fcee-49b1-8081-16a08a338099">The denote-prompts option</a>).
</p>

<p>
The <code>denote</code> command can also be called from Lisp.  Read its doc string
for the technicalities.
</p>

<p>
In the interest of discoverability, <code>denote</code> is also available under the
alias <code>denote-create-note</code>.

The user option <code>denote-prompts</code> determines how the <code>denote</code> command

</p>

<p>
Commands that prompt for user input to construct a Denote file name
include, but are not limited to: <code>denote</code>, <code>denote-signature</code>,
<code>denote-type</code>, <code>denote-date</code>, <code>denote-subdirectory</code>,
<code>denote-rename-file</code>, <code>denote-dired-rename-files</code>.

</ul>

<p>
The value of this user option is a list of symbols, which includes any
of the following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>title</code>: Prompt for the title of the new note (<a href="#h:403422a7-7578-494b-8f33-813874c12da3">The <code>denote-history-completion-in-prompts</code> option</a>).</li>

<li><code>keywords</code>: Prompts with completion for the keywords of the new note.
Available candidates are those specified in the user option
<code>denote-known-keywords</code>.  If the user option <code>denote-infer-keywords</code>
is non-nil, keywords in existing note file names are included in the
list of candidates.  The <code>keywords</code> prompt uses
<code>completing-read-multiple</code>, meaning that it can accept multiple
keywords separated by a comma (or whatever the value of <code>crm-separator</code>
is).</li>

<li><code>file-type</code>: Prompts with completion for the file type of the new
note.  Available candidates are those specified in the user option
<code>denote-file-type</code>.  Without this prompt, <code>denote</code> uses the value of
<code>denote-file-type</code>.</li>

<li><code>subdirectory</code>: Prompts with completion for a subdirectory in which to
create the note.  Available candidates are the value of the user
option <code>denote-directory</code> and all of its subdirectories.  Any
subdirectory must already exist: Denote will not create it.</li>

<li><p>
<code>date</code>: Prompts for the date of the new note.  It will expect an input
like 2022-06-16 or a date plus time: 2022-06-16 14:30.  Without the
<code>date</code> prompt, the <code>denote</code> command uses the <code>current-time</code>.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#h:e7ef08d6-af1b-4ab3-bb00-494a653e6d63">The denote-date-prompt-use-org-read-date option</a>.
</p></li>

<li><code>template</code>: Prompts for a KEY among the <code>denote-templates</code>.  The value
of that KEY is used to populate the new note with content, which is
added after the front matter (<a href="#h:f635a490-d29e-4608-9372-7bd13b34d56c">The denote-templates option</a>).</li>

<li><code>signature</code>: - Prompts for an arbitrary string that can be used for
any kind of workflow, such as a special tag to label the <code>part1</code> and
<code>part2</code> of a large file that is split in half, or to add special
contexts like <code>home</code> and <code>work</code>, or even priorities like <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>,
<code>c</code>. One other use-case is to implement a sequencing scheme that
makes notes have hierarchical relationships. This is handled by our
optional extension <code>denote-sequence.el</code>, which is part of the
<code>denote</code> package (<a href="#h:d5ca722d-e7fa-46fa-9a57-6363b1d4186f">Write sequence notes or &ldquo;folgezettel&rdquo;</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>
The prompts occur in the given order.
</p>

<p>
If the value of this user option is nil, no prompts are used.  The
resulting file name will consist of an identifier (i.e. the date and
time) and a supported file type extension (per <code>denote-file-type</code>).
</p>

<p>
Recall that Denote&rsquo;s standard file-naming scheme is defined as follows
(<a href="#h:4e9c7512-84dc-4dfb-9fa9-e15d51178e5d">The file-naming scheme</a>):
</p>

<pre class="example">
DATE--TITLE__KEYWORDS.EXT
</pre>


<p>
If either or both of the <code>title</code> and <code>keywords</code> prompts are not
included in the value of this variable, file names will be any of
those permutations:
</p>

<pre class="example">
DATE.EXT
DATE--TITLE.EXT
DATE__KEYWORDS.EXT
</pre>


<p>
When in doubt, always include the <code>title</code> and <code>keywords</code> prompts.
</p>

<p>
Finally, this user option only affects the interactive use of the
<code>denote</code> or other relevant commands (advanced users can call it from
Lisp). In Lisp usage, the behaviour is always what the caller
specifies, based on the supplied arguments.

The user option <code>denote-history-completion-in-prompts</code> toggles history
completion in all <code>denote-prompts-with-history-as-completion</code>.
</p>

<p>
When this user option is set to a non-nil value, Denote will use
minibuffer history entries as completion candidates in all of the
<code>denote-prompts-with-history-as-completion</code>. Those will show previous
inputs from their respective history as possible values to select,
either to (i) re-insert them verbatim or (ii) with the intent to edit
them further (depending on the minibuffer user interface, one can
select a candidate with <code>TAB</code> without exiting the minibuffer, as
opposed to what <code>RET</code> normally does by selecting and exiting).
</p>

<p>
When this user option is set to a nil value, all of the
<code>denote-prompts-with-history-as-completion</code> will not use minibuffer
completion: they will just prompt for a string of characters. Their
history is still available through all the standard ways of retrieving
minibuffer history, such as with the command <code>previous-history-element</code>.
</p>

<p>
History completion still allows arbitrary values to be provided as
input: they do not have to match the available minibuffer completion

Note that some prompts, like <code>denote-keywords-prompt</code>, always use

<p>
The user option <code>denote-templates</code> is an alist of content templates for
new notes.  A template is arbitrary text that Denote will add to a newly
created note right below the front matter.
</p>

<p>
Templates are expressed as a <code>(KEY . VALUE)</code> association.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The <code>KEY</code> is the name which identifies the template.  It is an
arbitrary symbol, such as <code>report</code>, <code>memo</code>, <code>statement</code>.</li>

<li>The <code>VALUE</code> is either a string or the symbol of a function.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If it is a string, it is ordinary text that Denote will insert
as-is.  It can contain newline characters to add spacing.  The
manual of Denote contains examples on how to use the <code>concat</code>
function, beside writing a generic string.</li>

<li>If it is a function, it is called without arguments and is expected
to return a string.  Denote will call the function and insert the
result in the buffer.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
The user can choose a template either by invoking the command
<code>denote-template</code> or by changing the user option <code>denote-prompts</code> to
always prompt for a template when calling the <code>denote</code> command.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
<a href="#h:887bdced-9686-4e80-906f-789e407f2e8f">Convenience commands for note creation</a>.
</p>

<p>
Templates can be written directly as one large string.  For example (the
<code>\n</code> character is read as a newline):
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(setq denote-templates
      '((report . "* Some heading\n\n* Another heading")
        (memo . "* Some heading

* Another heading

")))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Long strings may be easier to type but interpret indentation literally.
Also, they do not scale well.  A better way is to use some Elisp code to
construct the string.  This would typically be the <code>concat</code> function,
which joins multiple strings into one.  The following is the same as the
previous example:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(setq denote-templates
      `((report . "* Some heading\n\n* Another heading")
        (memo . ,(concat "* Some heading"
                         "\n\n"
                         "* Another heading"
                         "\n\n"))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Notice that to evaluate a function inside of an alist we use the
backtick to quote the alist (NOT the straight quote) and then prepend a
comma to the expression that should be evaluated.  The <code>concat</code> form
here is not sensitive to indentation, so it is easier to adjust for
legibility.
</p>

<p>
For when the <code>VALUE</code> is a function, we have this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(setq denote-templates
      `((report . "* Some heading\n\n* Another heading")
        (blog . my-denote-template-function-for-blog) ; a function to return a string
        (memo . ,(concat "* Some heading"
                         "\n\n"
                         "* Another heading"
                         "\n\n"))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
In this example, <code>my-denote-template-function-for-blog</code> is a function
that returns a string. Denote will take care to insert it in the buffer.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-h:887bdced-9686-4e80-906f-789e407f2e8f">
<p>
Sometimes the user needs to create a note that has different
requirements from those of <code>denote</code> (<a href="#h:6a92a8b5-d766-42cc-8e5b-8dc255466a23">Standard note creation</a>).  While
this can be achieved globally by changing the <code>denote-prompts</code> user

(<a href="#h:f9204f1f-fcee-49b1-8081-16a08a338099">The denote-prompts option</a>).
</p>

<p>
To this end, Denote provides the following interactive convenience
commands for note creation. They all work by appending a new prompt to
the existing <code>denote-prompts</code>.
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Create note by specifying file type</dt><dd><p>
The <code>denote-type</code> command
creates a note while prompting for a file type.
</p>

<p>
This is the equivalent of calling <code>denote</code> when <code>denote-prompts</code> has
the <code>file-type</code> prompt appended to its existing prompts. In practical
terms, this lets you produce, say, a note in Markdown even though
you normally write in Org (<a href="#h:6a92a8b5-d766-42cc-8e5b-8dc255466a23">Standard note creation</a>).
</p>

<p>
The <code>denote-create-note-using-type</code> is an alias of <code>denote-type</code>.
</p></dd>

<dt>Create note using a date</dt><dd><p>
Normally, Denote reads the current date
and time to construct the unique identifier of a newly created note
(<a href="#h:6a92a8b5-d766-42cc-8e5b-8dc255466a23">Standard note creation</a>).  Sometimes, however, the user needs to set
an explicit date+time value.
</p>

<p>
This is where the <code>denote-date</code> command comes in.  It creates a note
while prompting for a date.  The date can be in YEAR-MONTH-DAY
notation like <code>2022-06-30</code> or that plus the time: <code>2022-06-16 14:30</code>.

</p>

<p>
The <code>denote-create-note-using-date</code> is an alias of <code>denote-date</code>.
</p></dd>

<dt>Create note in a specific directory</dt><dd><p>
The <code>denote-subdirectory</code>
command creates a note while prompting for a subdirectory.  Available
candidates include the value of the variable <code>denote-directory</code> and

<p>
This is the equivalent of calling <code>denote</code> when <code>denote-prompts</code> has
the <code>subdirectory</code> prompt appended to its existing prompts.

<p>
The <code>denote-create-note-in-subdirectory</code> is a more descriptive alias
of <code>denote-subdirectory</code>.

<dt>Create note and add a template</dt><dd><p>
The <code>denote-template</code> command
creates a new note and inserts the specified template below the front
matter (<a href="#h:f635a490-d29e-4608-9372-7bd13b34d56c">The denote-templates option</a>).  Available candidates for

<p>
The <code>denote-create-note-with-template</code> is an alias of the command
<code>denote-template</code>, meant to help with discoverability.
</p></dd>

<dt>Create note with a signature</dt><dd><p>
The <code>denote-signature</code> command first
prompts for an arbitrary string to use in the optional <code>SIGNATURE</code>
field of the file name and then asks for a title and keywords.
Signatures are arbitrary strings of alphanumeric characters which
can be used to establish sequential relations between file at the
level of their file name (e.g. 1, 1a, 1b, 1b1, 1b2, &#x2026;).

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-h:11946562-7eb0-4925-a3b5-92d75f1f5895">
<p>
The convenience commands we provide only cover some basic use-cases
(<a href="#h:887bdced-9686-4e80-906f-789e407f2e8f">Convenience commands for note creation</a>). The user may require
combinations that are not covered, such as to prompt for a template
and for a subdirectory, instead of only one of the two. To this end,
we show how to follow the code we use in Denote to write your own
variants of those commands.
</p>

<p>
First let&rsquo;s take a look at the definition of one of those commands.
They all look the same, but we use <code>denote-subdirectory</code> for this
example:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(defun denote-subdirectory ()
  "Create note while prompting for a subdirectory.

Available candidates include the value of the variable
`denote-directory' and any subdirectory thereof.

This is the equivalent of calling `denote' when `denote-prompts'
has the `subdirectory' prompt appended to its existing prompts."
  (declare (interactive-only t))
  (interactive)
  (let ((denote-prompts (denote-add-prompts '(subdirectory))))
    (call-interactively #'denote)))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The hyphenated word after <code>defun</code> is the name of the function. It has
to be unique. Then we have the documentation string (or &ldquo;doc string&rdquo;)
which is for the user&rsquo;s convenience.
</p>

<p>
This function is <code>interactive</code>, meaning that it can be called via
<code>M-x</code> or be assigned to a key binding. Then we have the local binding
of the <code>denote-prompts</code> to the desired combination (&ldquo;local&rdquo; means
specific to this function without affecting other contexts). Lastly,
it calls the standard <code>denote</code> command interactively, so it uses all
the prompts in their specified order.
</p>

<p>
The function call <code>(denote-add-prompts '(subdirectory))</code> will append
the subdirectory prompt to the existing value of the <code>denote-prompts</code>.
If, for example, the default value is <code>'(title keywords)</code> (to prompt
for a title and then for keywords), it will become <code>'(subdirectory
title keywords)</code> inside the context of this <code>let</code>. Remember that this
is &ldquo;local&rdquo;, so the global value of <code>denote-prompts</code> remains unaffected.
</p>

<p>
Now let&rsquo;s say we want to have a command that (i) asks for a template
(ii) for a subdirectory (<a href="#h:f635a490-d29e-4608-9372-7bd13b34d56c">The denote-templates option</a>), and (iii) then
goes through the remaining <code>denote-prompts</code>. All we need to do is
tweak the <code>let</code> bound value of <code>denote-prompts</code> and give our command a
unique name:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">;; Like `denote-subdirectory' but also ask for a template
(defun my-denote-subdirectory-with-template ()
  "Create note while also prompting for a template and subdirectory.

This is the equivalent of calling `denote' when `denote-prompts' has the
`subdirectory' and `template' prompts appended to its existing prompts."
  (declare (interactive-only t))
  (interactive)
  (let ((denote-prompts (denote-add-prompts '(subdirectory template))))
    (call-interactively #'denote)))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The tweaks to <code>denote-prompts</code> determine how the command will behave
(<a href="#h:f9204f1f-fcee-49b1-8081-16a08a338099">The denote-prompts option</a>). Use this paradigm to write your own
variants which you can then assign to keys, invoke with <code>M-x</code>, or add
to the list of commands available at the <code>denote-command-prompt</code>
(<a href="#h:98c732ac-da0e-4ebd-a0e3-5c47f9075e51">Choose which commands to prompt for</a>).
</p>

<p>
In the above scenario, we are using the <code>denote-add-prompts</code> function,
which appends whatever prompts we want to the existing value of
<code>denote-prompts</code>. If the user prefers to completely override the
<code>denote-prompts</code>, they can set the value outright:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(defun my-denote-subdirectory-with-template-title-and-keywords ()
  "Create a note while prompting for subdirectory, template, title, and keywords.

This is the equivalent of calling `denote' when `denote-prompts' has the
value '(template subdirectory title keywords)."
  (declare (interactive-only t))
  (interactive)
  (let ((denote-prompts '(subdirectory template title keywords)))
    (call-interactively #'denote)))
</pre>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-h:bf80f4cd-6f56-4f7c-a991-8573161e4511">
<p>
The user option <code>denote-save-buffer-after-creation</code> controls whether
commands that create new notes save their buffer outright.
</p>

<p>
The default behaviour of commands such as <code>denote</code> (or related) is to
not save the buffer they create (<a href="#h:17896c8c-d97a-4faa-abf6-31df99746ca6">Points of entry</a>). This gives the user
the chance to review the text before writing it to a file. The user
may choose to delete the unsaved buffer, thus not creating a new note
(<a href="#h:bf80f4cd-6f56-4f7c-a991-8573161e4511">The <code>denote-save-buffer-after-creation</code> option</a>).
</p>

<p>
This option also applies to notes affected by the renaming commands
(<code>denote-rename-file</code> and related).
</p>

<p>
If this user option is set to a non-nil value, such buffers are saved
automatically. The assumption is that the user who opts in to this
feature is familiar with the <code>denote-rename-file</code> operation (or
related) and knows it is reliable (<a href="#h:532e8e2a-9b7d-41c0-8f4b-3c5cbb7d4dca">Renaming files</a>).

<p>
The user option <code>denote-kill-buffers</code> controls whether to kill a

creating a new file or renaming an existing one.

<li><a href="#h:17896c8c-d97a-4faa-abf6-31df99746ca6">Points of entry</a>.</li>
<li><a href="#h:532e8e2a-9b7d-41c0-8f4b-3c5cbb7d4dca">Renaming files</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The default behaviour of creation or renaming commands such as
<code>denote</code> or <code>denote-rename-file</code> is to not kill the buffer they
create or modify at the end of their operation. The idea is to give
the user the chance to confirm that everything is in order.
</p>

<p>
If this user option is nil (the default), buffers affected by a
creation or renaming command are not automatically killed.
</p>

<p>
If set to the symbol <code>on-creation</code>, new notes are automatically killed.
</p>

<p>
If set to the symbol <code>on-rename</code>, renamed notes are automatically
killed.
</p>

<p>
If set to t, new and renamed notes are killed.
</p>

<p>
If a buffer is killed, it is also saved, as if <code>denote-save-buffers</code>
were t (<a href="#h:bf80f4cd-6f56-4f7c-a991-8573161e4511">The <code>denote-save-buffers</code> option</a>).

<code>denote-prompts</code> option includes a <code>date</code> symbol and/or when the user
invokes the <code>denote-date</code> command.
</p>

<p>

that is common in interactions with Org mode, can set the user option
<code>denote-date-prompt-use-org-read-date</code> to a non-nil value.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:d0c7cb79-21e5-4176-a6af-f4f68578c8dd">
<p>
In Org parlance, an entry with all its subheadings and other contents
is a &ldquo;subtree&rdquo;. Denote can operate on the subtree to extract it from
the current file and create a new file out of it. One such workflow is
to collect thoughts in a single document and produce longer standalone
notes out of them upon review.
</p>

<p>
The command <code>denote-org-extras-extract-org-subtree</code> is used for this
purpose. It creates a new Denote note using the current Org subtree.
In doing so, it removes the subtree from its current file and moves
its contents into a new file. This command is part of the optional
<code>denote-org-extras.el</code> extension, which is part of the <code>denote</code>
package. It is loaded automatically as soon as one of its commands is
invoked.
</p>

<p>
The text of the subtree&rsquo;s heading becomes the <code>#+title</code> of the new
note. Everything else is inserted as-is.
</p>

<p>
If the heading has any tags, they are used as the keywords of the new
note. If the Org file has any <code>#+filetags</code> they are taken as well
(Org&rsquo;s <code>#+filetags</code> are inherited by the headings). If none of these
are true and the user option <code>denote-prompts</code> includes an entry for
keywords, then <code>denote-org-extras-extract-org-subtree</code> prompts for
keywords. Else the new note has no keywords (<a href="#h:ad4dde4a-8e88-470a-97ae-e7b9d4b41fb4">Add or remove keywords interactively</a>).
</p>

<p>
If the heading has a <code>PROPERTIES</code> drawer, it is retained for further
review.
</p>

<p>
If the heading&rsquo;s <code>PROPERTIES</code> drawer includes a <code>DATE</code> or <code>CREATED</code>
property, or there exists a <code>CLOSED</code> statement with a timestamp value,
use that to derive the date (or date and time) of the new note (if
there is only a date, the time is taken as 00:00). If more than one of
these is present, the order of preference is <code>DATE</code>, then <code>CREATED</code>,
then <code>CLOSED</code>. If none of these is present, the current time is used.
If the <code>denote-prompts</code> includes an entry for a date, then the command
prompts for a date at this stage (also see <code>denote-date-prompt-use-org-read-date</code>).
</p>

<p>
For the rest, it consults the value of the user option
<code>denote-prompts</code> in the following scenaria:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>To optionally prompt for a subdirectory, otherwise it produces the
new note in the <code>denote-directory</code>.</li>
<li>To optionally prompt for a file signature, otherwise to not use any.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The new note is an Org file regardless of the user option
<code>denote-file-type</code>.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-h:656c70cd-cf9a-4471-a0b5-4f0aaf60f881" class="outline-3">

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:656c70cd-cf9a-4471-a0b5-4f0aaf60f881">
<p>
For integration with <code>org-capture</code>, the user must first add the relevant
template.  Such as:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(with-eval-after-load 'org-capture
  (add-to-list 'org-capture-templates
               '("n" "New note (with Denote)" plain
                 (file denote-last-path)
                 #'denote-org-capture
                 :no-save t
                 :immediate-finish nil
                 :kill-buffer t
                 :jump-to-captured t)))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Once the template is added, it is accessed from the specified key. If,
for instance, <code>org-capture</code> is bound to <code>C-c c</code>, then the note
creation is initiated with <code>C-c c n</code>, per the above snippet. After
that, the process is the same as with invoking <code>denote</code> directly,
namely: a prompt for a title followed by a prompt for keywords,
assuming the default settings (<a href="#h:6a92a8b5-d766-42cc-8e5b-8dc255466a23">Standard note creation</a>). Concretely,
this method always respects the value of the user option
<code>denote-prompts</code> (<a href="#h:f9204f1f-fcee-49b1-8081-16a08a338099">The <code>denote-prompts</code> option</a>).
</p>

<p>
It is also possible to define templates that have specific prompts or
certain values set, for which there is no prompt:

Users may prefer to leverage <code>org-capture</code> in order to extend file
creation with the specifiers described in the <code>org-capture-templates</code>
documentation (such as to capture the active region and/or create a
hyperlink pointing to the given context).
</p>

<p>
IMPORTANT.  Due to the particular file-naming scheme of Denote, which is
derived dynamically, such specifiers or other arbitrary text cannot be
written directly in the template.  Instead, they have to be assigned to
the user option <code>denote-org-capture-specifiers</code>, which is interpreted by
the function <code>denote-org-capture</code>.  Example with our default value:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(setq denote-org-capture-specifiers "%l\n%i\n%?")
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Note that <code>denote-org-capture</code> ignores the <code>denote-file-type</code>: it always
sets the Org file extension for the created note to ensure that the
capture process works as intended, especially for the desired output of
the <code>denote-org-capture-specifiers</code>.
</p>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:95b78582-9086-47e8-967f-62373e2369a0">
<p>
This section assumes knowledge of how Denote+org-capture work, as
explained in the previous section (<a href="#h:656c70cd-cf9a-4471-a0b5-4f0aaf60f881">Create note using Org capture</a>).
</p>

<p>
The previous section shows how to define an Org capture template that
always prompts for whatever is set in the user option <code>denote-prompts</code>
(title and keywords, by default). There are, however, cases where the
user wants more control over what kind of input Denote will prompt
for. To this end, we provide the function <code>denote-org-capture-with-prompts</code>.
Below we explain it and then show some examples of how to use it.
</p>

<p>
The <code>denote-org-capture-with-prompts</code> is like <code>denote-org-capture</code> but
with optional prompt parameters.
</p>

<p>
When called without arguments, it does not prompt for anything.  It
just returns the front matter with title and keyword fields empty and
the date and identifier fields specified.  It also makes the file name
consist of only the identifier plus the Org file name extension (<a href="#h:4e9c7512-84dc-4dfb-9fa9-e15d51178e5d">The file-naming scheme</a>).
</p>

<p>
Otherwise, it produces a minibuffer prompt for every non-nil value
that corresponds to the <code>TITLE</code>, <code>KEYWORDS</code>, <code>SUBDIRECTORY</code>, <code>DATE</code>,
and <code>TEMPLATE</code> arguments.  The prompts are those used by the standard
<code>denote</code> command and all of its utility commands (<a href="#h:17896c8c-d97a-4faa-abf6-31df99746ca6">Points of entry</a>).
</p>

<p>
When returning the contents that fill in the Org capture template, the
sequence is as follows: front matter, <code>TEMPLATE</code>, and then the value
of the user option <code>denote-org-capture-specifiers</code>.
</p>

<p>
Important note: in the case of <code>SUBDIRECTORY</code> actual subdirectories
must exist&#x2014;Denote does not create them.  Same principle for
<code>TEMPLATE</code> as templates must exist and are specified in the user
option <code>denote-templates</code>.
</p>

<p>
This is how one can incorporate <code>denote-org-capture-with-prompts</code> in
their Org capture templates.  Instead of passing a generic <code>t</code> which
makes it hard to remember what the argument means, we use semantic
keywords like <code>:title</code> for our convenience (internally this does not
matter as the value still counts as non-nil, so <code>:foo</code> for <code>TITLE</code> is
treated the same as <code>:title</code> or <code>t</code>).

The ordinary procedure to create a note with <code>org-capture</code> respects
the value of the user option <code>denote-prompts</code> (<a href="#h:656c70cd-cf9a-4471-a0b5-4f0aaf60f881">Create note using Org capture</a>):
the user is prompted for all the values they have configured (title
and keywords, by default). Sometimes, there is no need to have a
certain prompt because the value of it will be constant. For example,
the user wants to have a template that (i) respects the
<code>denote-prompts</code> but (ii) puts the new note in an existing subdirectory
of the <code>denote-directory</code>. The following code block does exactly that.
</p>

<p>
[ It also is possible to have a template that deviates from
  <code>denote-prompts</code> and prompts for specific values (<a href="#h:95b78582-9086-47e8-967f-62373e2369a0">Create note with specific prompts using Org capture</a>). ]

corresponding prompt is always skipped. It is thus paramount to never
set those variables outside the scope of a <code>let</code> (or equivalent).

wants to have a constant value for the subdirectory but also be
prompted for a date.

<p>
Denote can be used for a free-form journaling out-of-the-box. We also
provide the <code>denote-journal-extras.el</code> file, which contains extensions
for a more streamlined workflow (<a href="#h:4a6d92dd-19eb-4fcc-a7b5-05ce04da3a92">Keep a journal or diary</a>).
</p>

<p>
One of the features of those extras is the ability to create a Denote
file for a given day, if there is none, but revisit the file if it
exists. Users can thus leverage this to set up a workflow where they
quickly add a new heading to their daily journal file via the command
<code>org-capture</code>:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(with-eval-after-load 'org-capture
  (add-to-list 'org-capture-templates
               '("j" "Journal" entry

                 :kill-buffer t
                 :empty-lines 1)))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Using the above, is the same as calling the command
<code>denote-journal-extras-new-or-existing-entry</code> and then manually
appending a heading with a timestamp. The template can be modified
accordingly, in accordance with the documentation of <code>org-capture-templates</code>.
</p>

<p>
The command <code>denote-region</code> takes the contents of the active region
and then calls the <code>denote</code> command.  Once a new note is created, it
inserts the contents of the region therein.  This is useful to
quickly elaborate on some snippet of text or capture it for future
reference.
</p>

<p>
When the <code>denote-region</code> command is called with an active region, it
finalises its work by calling <code>denote-region-after-new-note-functions</code>.
This is an abnormal hook, meaning that the functions added to it are
called with arguments.  The arguments are two, representing the
beginning and end positions of the newly inserted text.
</p>

<p>
A common use-case for Org mode users is to call the command
<code>org-insert-structure-template</code> after a region is inserted.  Emacs
will thus prompt for a structure template, such as the one
corresponding to a source block.  In this case the function added to
<code>denote-region-after-new-note-functions</code> does not actually need
aforementioned arguments: it can simply declare those as ignored by
prefixing the argument names with an underscore (an underscore is
enough, but it is better to include a name for clarity).  For example,
the following will prompt for a structure template as soon as
<code>denote-region</code> is done:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(defun my-denote-region-org-structure-template (_beg _end)

<p>
Remember that <code>denote-region-after-new-note-functions</code> are not called
if <code>denote-region</code> is used without an active region.

However, users may want a more streamlined workflow where the command
is always used to capture quotes from other sources. In this example,
we consider &ldquo;other sources&rdquo; to come from Emacs EWW buffers (with <code>M-x
eww</code>) or regular files outside the <code>denote-directory</code>.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:ad91ca39-cf10-4e16-b224-fdf78f093883">
<p>
Sometimes it is necessary to briefly interrupt the ongoing writing
session to open an existing note or, if that is missing, to create it.
This happens when a new tangential thought occurs and the user wants
to confirm that an entry for it is in place.  To this end, Denote
provides the command <code>denote-open-or-create</code> as well as its more
flexible counterpart <code>denote-open-or-create-with-command</code>.
</p>

<p>
The <code>denote-open-or-create</code> prompts to visit a file in the
<code>denote-directory</code>.  At this point, the user must type in search terms
that match a file name.  If the input does not return any matches and
the user confirms their choice to proceed (usually by typing RET
twice, depending on the minibuffer settings), <code>denote-open-or-create</code>
will call the <code>denote</code> command interactively to create a new note.  It
will then use whatever prompts <code>denote</code> normally has, per the user
option <code>denote-prompts</code> (<a href="#h:6a92a8b5-d766-42cc-8e5b-8dc255466a23">Standard note creation</a>).  If the title prompt
is involved (the default behaviour), the <code>denote-open-or-create</code> sets
up this prompt to have the previous input as the default title of the
note to-be-created.  This means that the user can type RET at the
empty prompt to re-use what they typed in previously.  Commands to use
previous inputs from the history are also available (<code>M-p</code> or <code>M-n</code> in
the minibuffer, which call <code>previous-history-element</code> and
<code>next-history-element</code> by default).  Accessing the history is helpful
to, for example, make further edits to the available text.
</p>

<p>
The <code>denote-open-or-create-with-command</code> is like the above, except
when it is about to create the new note it first prompts for the
specific file-creating command to use (<a href="#h:17896c8c-d97a-4faa-abf6-31df99746ca6">Points of entry</a>).  For example,
the user may want to specify a signature for this new file, so they
can select the <code>denote-signature</code> command.
</p>

<p>
Denote provides similar functionality for linking to an existing note
or creating a new one (<a href="#h:b6056e6b-93df-4e6b-a778-eebd105bac46">Link to a note or create it if missing</a>).

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:15719799-a5ff-4e9a-9f10-4ca03ef8f6c5">
<p>
The user option <code>denote-directory</code> accepts a value that represents the
path to a directory, such as <code>~/Documents/notes</code>.  Normally, the user
will have one place where they store all their notes, in which case this
arrangement shall suffice.
</p>

<p>
There is, however, the possibility to maintain separate directories of
notes.  By &ldquo;separate&rdquo;, we mean that they do not communicate with each
other: no linking between them, no common keywords, nothing.  Think of
the scenario where one set of notes is for private use and another is
for an employer.  We call these separate directories &ldquo;silos&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
To create silos, the user must specify a local variable at the root of
the desired directory.  This is done by creating a <code>.dir-locals.el</code>
file, with the following contents:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">;;; Directory Local Variables.  For more information evaluate:
;;;
;;;     (info "(emacs) Directory Variables")

((nil . ((denote-directory . "/path/to/silo/"))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
When inside the directory that contains this <code>.dir-locals.el</code> file,
all Denote commands/functions for note creation, linking, the
inference of available keywords, et cetera will use the silo as their
point of reference (<a href="#h:e0d60749-194d-4677-b943-5e98fbf9ad1d">How to switch a silo</a>). They will not read the
global value of <code>denote-directory</code>. The global value of
<code>denote-directory</code> is read everywhere else except the silos.

(notice the <code>.dir-locals.el</code> file is needed only for the silos):

<p>
It is possible to configure other user options of Denote to have a
silo-specific value.  For example, this one changes the
<code>denote-known-keywords</code> only for this particular silo:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">;;; Directory Local Variables.  For more information evaluate:
;;;
;;;     (info "(emacs) Directory Variables")

((nil . ((denote-directory . "/path/to/silo/")
         (denote-known-keywords . ("food" "drink")))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This one is like the above, but also disables <code>denote-infer-keywords</code>:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">;;; Directory Local Variables.  For more information evaluate:
;;;
;;;     (info "(emacs) Directory Variables")

((nil . ((denote-directory . "/path/to/silo/")
         (denote-known-keywords . ("food" "drink"))
         (denote-infer-keywords . nil))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
To expand the list of local variables to, say, cover specific major
modes, we can do something like this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">;;; Directory Local Variables.  For more information evaluate:
;;;
;;;     (info "(emacs) Directory Variables")

((nil . ((denote-directory . "/path/to/silo/")
         (denote-known-keywords . ("food" "drink"))
         (denote-infer-keywords . nil)))
 (org-mode . ((org-hide-emphasis-markers . t)
              (org-hide-macro-markers . t)
              (org-hide-leading-stars . t))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
As not all user options have a &ldquo;safe&rdquo; local value, Emacs will ask the
user to confirm their choice and to store it in the Custom code
snippet that is normally appended to init file (or added to the file
specified by the user option <code>custom-file</code>).
</p>

<p>
Finally, it is possible to have a <code>.dir-locals.el</code> for subdirectories
of any <code>denote-directory</code>.  Perhaps to specify a different set of
known keywords, while not making the subdirectory a silo in its own
right.  We shall not expand on such an example, as we trust the user
to experiment with the best setup for their workflow.

Switching to a silo directory will make all Denote commands use the
silo&rsquo;s path as the <code>denote-directory</code>, instead of the global value of
that variable (<a href="#h:15719799-a5ff-4e9a-9f10-4ca03ef8f6c5">Maintain separate directory silos for notes</a>). There are
three ways to switch to a silo:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Visit a file inside of that directory.</li>
<li>Use the <code>dired</code> command to open the directory in a buffer.</li>
<li>Use the command <code>cd</code> to select the directory without moving away
from the current buffer.</li>
</ol>

</p>

<p>
We implement silos as directory-local values of the user option
<code>denote-directory</code>.  This means that all Denote commands read from the
local value if they are invoked from that context.  For example, if
<code>~/Videos/recordings</code> is a silo and <code>~/Documents/notes</code> is the
default/global value of <code>denote-directory</code> all Denote commands will
read the video&rsquo;s path when called from there (e.g. by using Emacs&rsquo;
<code>dired</code>); any other context reads the global value.

<p>
There are cases where the user (i) wants to maintain multiple silos
and (ii) prefers an interactive way to switch between them without
going through Dired.  Since this is specific to the user&rsquo;s workflow,
it is easier to have some custom code for it.  The following should be
added to the user&rsquo;s Denote configuration:
</p>

<p>
Note that <code>let</code> binding <code>denote-directory</code> can be used in custom
commands and other wrapper functions to override the global default
value of <code>denote-directory</code> to select silos.

<code>denote-directory</code>, see:

The <code>denote-silo-extras.el</code> provides optional convenience functions for
working with silos (<a href="#h:15719799-a5ff-4e9a-9f10-4ca03ef8f6c5">Maintain separate directory silos for notes</a>).
Start by loading the relevant library:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(require 'denote-silo-extras)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The user option <code>denote-silo-extras-directories</code> specifies a list of
directories that the user has set up as <code>denote-directory</code> silos.
</p>

<p>
The command <code>denote-silo-extras-create-note</code> prompts for a directory
among <code>denote-silo-extras-directories</code> and runs the <code>denote</code> command
from there.
</p>

<p>
Similar to the above, the command <code>denote-silo-extras-open-or-create</code>
prompts for a directory among <code>denote-silo-extras-directories</code> and runs
the <code>denote-open-or-create</code> command from there.
</p>

<p>
The command <code>denote-silo-extras-select-silo-then-command</code> prompts with
minibuffer completion for a directory among <code>denote-silo-extras-directories</code>.
Once the user selects a silo, a second prompt asks for a Denote
note-creation command to call from inside that silo (<a href="#h:17896c8c-d97a-4faa-abf6-31df99746ca6">Points of entry</a>).

Users who rely on silos may have a need to quickly switch between
directories. This can be done with bookmarks or projects, both of
which are built into Emacs:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="#h:1bba4c1e-6812-4749-948f-57df4fd49b36">Bookmark the directory with the notes</a>.</li>

</ul>

<p>
Another approach is to use the following small custom commands to (i)
be prompted for a silo and (ii) either use <code>cd</code> or <code>dired</code> to switch
to it.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(defun my-denote-silo-extras-dired-to-silo (silo)

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-h:fed09992-7c43-4237-b48f-f654bc29d1d8">
<p>
The Org export infrastructure is designed to ignore directory-local
variables. This means that Denote silos, which depend on setting the
local value of the variable <code>denote-directory</code>, do not work as
intended (<a href="#h:15719799-a5ff-4e9a-9f10-4ca03ef8f6c5">Maintain separate directory silos for notes</a>). More
specifically, the Denote links do not resolve to the right file,
because their path is changed during the export process.
</p>

<p>
I brought this to the attention of the Org maintainer. The guidance
from their side is to use the <code>#+bind</code> keyword to specify a local
value for the <code>denote-directory</code>: <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/2024-06/msg00206.html">https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/2024-06/msg00206.html</a>.
The prerequisite is to set <code>org-export-allow-bind-keywords</code> to a
non-nil value:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(setq org-export-allow-bind-keywords t)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
I do not think this is an elegant solution, but here are two possible
ways to go about it, anyway:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
Manually add the <code>#+bind</code> keyword to each file you want to export.
It has to be like this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">   #+bind: denote-directory "/path/to/silo/"
</pre>
</div></li>

<li><p>
Alternatively, you can make the Org front matter that Denote uses
for new files automatically include the <code>#+bind</code> keyword with its
desired value. Here is a complete <code>.dir-locals.el</code> which (i)
defines the silo and (ii) modifies the <code>denote-org-front-matter</code>
accordingly:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">   ;;; Directory Local Variables.  For more information evaluate:
   ;;;
   ;;;     (info "(emacs) Directory Variables")

   ((nil . ((denote-directory . "/path/to/silo/")
            (denote-org-front-matter .
             "#+title:      %s
#+date:       %s
#+filetags:   %s
#+identifier: %s
#+bind:       denote-directory \"/path/to/silo/\"
\n"))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
[ Note that if you are reading the Org source of this manual, you
  need to use the command <code>org-edit-special</code> on the above code
  blocks before copying the code. This is because Org automatically
  prepends a comma to disambiguate those entries from actual
  keywords of the current file. ]

Denote silos are instantiated with a directory-local value for the
<code>denote-directory</code> (<a href="#h:15719799-a5ff-4e9a-9f10-4ca03ef8f6c5">Maintain separate directory silos for notes</a>). This
means that all Denote commands will operate on the silo when the user
is inside of that directory (<a href="#h:e0d60749-194d-4677-b943-5e98fbf9ad1d">How to switch a silo</a>). Sometimes though,
the user may not want to switch to the silo, then call a Denote
command, and finally switch away from the silo: this context change
can be done only for the duration of a command.
</p>

<p>
Here we show how easy it is to transiently bind the value of the
<code>denote-directory</code> to the path of a silo (well, any path for that
matter).

    (call-interactively 'denote-journal-extras-new-or-existing-entry)))

<p>
All the user needs to do here is change the exact command that is

With this in place, the user can now call their own command, such as
the <code>my-denote-journal-extras-new-or-existing-entry</code> shown above, when
they need to write a note there without manually switching to the
silo. Of course, these commands can be assigned to key bindings for
greater convenience. For example:
</p>

Denote registers a submenu for the <code>menu-bar-mode</code>.  Users will find
the entry called &ldquo;Denote&rdquo;.  From there they can use their pointer to
select a command.  For a sample of how this looks, read the
development log: <a href="https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2023-03-31-emacs-denote-menu/">https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2023-03-31-emacs-denote-menu/</a>.

<p>
The command <code>denote-menu-bar-mode</code> toggles the presentation of the
menu. It is enabled by default.

<p>
Emacs also provides support for operations through a context menu.
This is typically the set of actions that are made available via a
right mouse click.  Users who enable <code>context-menu-mode</code> can register
the Denote entry for it by adding the following to their configuration
file:

<p>
Denote provides commands to rename files and update their front matter
where relevant.  For Denote to work, only the file name needs to be in
order, by following our naming conventions (<a href="#h:4e9c7512-84dc-4dfb-9fa9-e15d51178e5d">The file-naming scheme</a>).
The linking mechanism, in particular, needs just the identifier in the
file name (<a href="#h:fc913d54-26c8-4c41-be86-999839e8ad31">Linking notes</a>).
</p>

<p>
We write front matter in notes for the user&rsquo;s convenience and for other
tools to make use of that information (e.g. Org&rsquo;s export mechanism).
The renaming mechanism takes care to keep this data in sync with the
file name, when the user performs a change.
</p>

<p>
Renaming is useful for managing existing files created with Denote,
but also for converting older text files to Denote notes.  Denote&rsquo;s
file-naming scheme is not specific to notes or text files: it is
relevant for all sorts of items, such as multimedia and PDFs that form
part of the user&rsquo;s longer-term storage.  While Denote does not manage
such files (e.g. doesn&rsquo;t create links to them), it already has all the
mechanisms to facilitate the task of renaming them.
</p>

<p>
All renaming commands run the <code>denote-after-rename-file-hook</code> after a
succesful operation. They also construct the file name in accordance
with the user option <code>denote-file-name-components-order</code> (<a href="#h:dc8c40e0-233a-4991-9ad3-2cf5f05ef1cd">Change the order of file name components</a>).
</p>

<p>
Apart from renaming files, Denote can also rename only the buffer.
The idea is that the underlying file name is correct but it can be
easier to use shorter buffer names when displaying them on the mode
line or switching between then with commands like <code>switch-to-buffer</code>.

<p>
The <code>denote-rename-file</code> command renames a file and updates existing
front matter if appropriate. It is possible to do the same with
multiple files (<a href="#h:1b6b2c78-42f0-45b8-9ef0-6de21a8b2cde">Rename multiple files interactively</a>).
</p>

<p>
It always renames the file where it is located in the file system:
it never moves it to another directory.
</p>

<p>
If in Dired, it considers <code>FILE</code> to be the one at point, else it
prompts with minibuffer completion for one. When called from Lisp,
<code>FILE</code> is a file system path represented as a string.
</p>

<p>
If <code>FILE</code> has a Denote-compliant identifier, it retains it while
updating components of the file name referenced by the user option
<code>denote-prompts</code> (<a href="#h:f9204f1f-fcee-49b1-8081-16a08a338099">The <code>denote-prompts</code> option</a>). By default, these are
the <code>TITLE</code> and <code>KEYWORDS</code>. The <code>SIGNATURE</code> is another one. When
called from Lisp, <code>TITLE</code> and <code>SIGNATURE</code> are strings, while
<code>KEYWORDS</code> is a list of strings.
</p>

<p>
If there is no identifier, <code>denote-rename-file</code> creates an identifier
based on the following conditions:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>If the <code>denote-prompts</code> includes an entry for date prompts, then it
prompts for <code>DATE</code> and takes its input to produce a new identifier. For
use in Lisp, <code>DATE</code> must conform with <code>denote-valid-date-p</code>.</li>

<li>If <code>DATE</code> is nil (e.g. when <code>denote-prompts</code> does not include a
date entry), it uses the file attributes to determine the last
modified date of <code>FILE</code> and formats it as an identifier.</li>

<li>As a fallback, it derives an identifier from the current date and
time.</li>

<li>At any rate, if the resulting identifier is not unique among the
files in the variable <code>denote-directory</code>, it increments it such
that it becomes unique.</li>
</ol>

<p>
In interactive use, and assuming <code>denote-prompts</code> includes a title
entry, the <code>denote-rename-file</code> makes the <code>TITLE</code> prompt have
prefilled text in the minibuffer that consists of the current title of
<code>FILE</code>. The current title is either retrieved from the front matter
(such as the <code>#+title</code> in Org) or from the file name.
</p>

<p>
The command does the same for the <code>SIGNATURE</code> prompt, subject to
<code>denote-prompts</code>, by prefilling the minibuffer with the current
signature of <code>FILE</code>, if any.
</p>

<p>
Same principle for the <code>KEYWORDS</code> prompt: it converts the keywords in
the file name into a comma-separated string and prefills the minibuffer
with it (the <code>KEYWORDS</code> prompt accepts more than one keywords, each
separated by a comma, else the <code>crm-separator</code>).
</p>

<p>
For all prompts, the <code>denote-rename-file</code> interprets an empty input as
an instruction to remove that file name component. For example, if a
<code>TITLE</code> prompt is available and <code>FILE</code> is <code>20240211T093531--some-title__keyword1.org</code>
then it renames <code>FILE</code> to <code>20240211T093531__keyword1.org</code>.
</p>

<p>
In interactive use, if there is no entry for a file name component in
<code>denote-prompts</code>, keep it as-is (<a href="#h:f9204f1f-fcee-49b1-8081-16a08a338099">The <code>denote-prompts</code> option</a>).
</p>

<p>
When called from Lisp, the special symbol `keep-current&rsquo; can be
used for the TITLE, KEYWORDS, SIGNATURE and DATE parameters to
keep them as-is.
</p>

<p>
[ NOTE: Please check with your minibuffer user interface how to
  provide an empty input. The Emacs default setup accepts the empty
  minibuffer contents as they are, though popular packages like
  <code>vertico</code> use the first available completion candidate instead. For
  <code>vertico</code>, the user must either move one up to select the prompt and
  then type <code>RET</code> there with empty contents, or use the command
  <code>vertico-exit-input</code> with empty contents. That Vertico command is
  bound to <code>M-RET</code> as of this writing on 2024-02-13 08:08 +0200. ]
</p>

<p>
When renaming <code>FILE</code>, the command reads its file type extension (like
<code>.org</code>) and preserves it through the renaming process. Files that have
no extension are left without one.
</p>

<p>
As a final step, ask for confirmation, showing the difference
between old and new file names.  Do not ask for confirmation if
the user option <code>denote-rename-confirmations</code> does not contain
the symbol <code>modify-file-name</code> (<a href="#h:a2ae9090-c49e-4b32-bcf5-eb8944241fd7">The <code>denote-rename-confirmations</code> option</a>).
</p>

<p>
If <code>FILE</code> has front matter for <code>TITLE</code> and <code>KEYWORDS</code>, ask to rewrite
their values in order to reflect the new input, unless
<code>denote-rename-confirmations</code> lacks <code>rewrite-front-matter</code>. When the
<code>denote-save-buffers</code> is nil (the default), do not save the underlying
buffer, thus giving the user the option to double-check the result,
such as by invoking the command <code>diff-buffer-with-file</code>. The rewrite
of the <code>TITLE</code> and <code>KEYWORDS</code> in the front matter should not affect
the rest of the front matter.
</p>

<p>
If the file does not have front matter but is among the supported file
types (per <code>denote-file-type</code>), add front matter to the top of it and
leave the buffer unsaved for further inspection (<a href="#h:13218826-56a5-482a-9b91-5b6de4f14261">Front matter</a>). Save
the buffer if <code>denote-save-buffers</code> is non-nil (<a href="#h:bf80f4cd-6f56-4f7c-a991-8573161e4511">The <code>denote-save-buffers</code> option</a>).
</p>

<p>
Construct the file name in accordance with the user option
<code>denote-file-name-components-order</code> (<a href="#h:dc8c40e0-233a-4991-9ad3-2cf5f05ef1cd">Change the order of file name components</a>).
</p>

<p>
Run the <code>denote-after-rename-file-hook</code> after renaming <code>FILE</code>.
</p>

<p>
This command is intended to (i) rename Denote files, (ii) convert
existing supported file types to Denote notes, and (ii) rename
non-note files (e.g. <code>PDF</code>) that can benefit from Denote&rsquo;s file-naming
scheme.
</p>

<p>
For a version of this command that works with multiple files
one-by-one, use <code>denote-dired-rename-files</code> (<a href="#h:1b6b2c78-42f0-45b8-9ef0-6de21a8b2cde">Rename multiple files interactively</a>).

<p>
The user option <code>denote-rename-confirmations</code> controls what kind of
confirmation renaming commands ask for (<a href="#h:532e8e2a-9b7d-41c0-8f4b-3c5cbb7d4dca">Renaming files</a>).  Its value is
a list of symbols.
</p>

<p>
The value is either nil, in which case no confirmation is ever
requested, or a list of symbols among the following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>modify-file-name</code> means that renaming commands will ask for
confirmation before modifying the file name.</li>

<li><code>rewrite-front-matter</code> means that renaming commands will ask for
confirmation before rewritting the front matter.</li>

<li><code>add-front-matter</code> means that renaming commands will ask for
confirmation before adding new front matter to the file.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The default behaviour of the <code>denote-rename-file</code> command (and others
like it) is to ask for an affirmative answer as a final step before
changing the file name and, where relevant, inserting or updating the
corresponding front matter.
</p>

<p>
Specialized commands that build on top of <code>denote-rename-file</code> (or
related) may internally bind this user option to a non-nil value in
order to perform their operation (e.g. <code>denote-dired-rename-files</code>
goes through each marked Dired file, prompting for the information to
use, but carries out the renaming without asking for confirmation
(<a href="#h:1b6b2c78-42f0-45b8-9ef0-6de21a8b2cde">Rename multiple files interactively</a>)).

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:3ab08ff4-81fa-4d24-99cb-79f97c13a373">
<p>
In the previous section, we covered the more general mechanism of the
command <code>denote-rename-file</code> (<a href="#h:7cc9e000-806a-48da-945c-711bbc7426b0">Rename a single file</a>).  There is also a
way to have the same outcome by making Denote read the data in the
current file&rsquo;s front matter and use it to construct/update the file
name.  The command for this is <code>denote-rename-file-using-front-matter</code>.
It is only relevant for files that (i) are among the supported file
types, per <code>denote-file-type</code>, and (ii) have the requisite front matter
in place.
</p>

<p>
Suppose you have an <code>.org</code> file with this front matter (<a href="#h:13218826-56a5-482a-9b91-5b6de4f14261">Front matter</a>):
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgd9cace5">
#+title:      My sample note file
#+date:       [2022-08-05 Fri 13:10]
#+filetags:   :testing:
#+identifier: 20220805T131044
</pre>

<p>
Its file name reflects this information:
</p>

<pre class="example">
20220805T131044--my-sample-note-file__testing.org
</pre>


<p>
You want to change its title and keywords manually, so you modify it thus:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org871b81d">
#+title:      My modified sample note file
#+date:       [2022-08-05 Fri 13:10]
#+filetags:   :testing:denote:emacs:
#+identifier: 20220805T131044
</pre>

<p>
At this stage, the file name still shows the old title and keywords.
You now invoke <code>denote-rename-file-using-front-matter</code> and it updates
the file name to:
</p>

<pre class="example">
20220805T131044--my-modified-sample-note-file__testing_denote_emacs.org
</pre>


<p>
By default, the renaming is subject to a &ldquo;yes or no&rdquo; prompt that shows
the old and new names, just so the user is certain about the change.
Though this can be modified (<a href="#h:a2ae9090-c49e-4b32-bcf5-eb8944241fd7">The <code>denote-rename-confirmations</code> option</a>).
</p>

<p>
The identifier of the file, if any, is never modified even if it is
edited in the front matter: Denote considers the file name to be the
source of truth in this case, to avoid potential breakage with typos and
the like.
</p>

<p>
This command constructs the file name in accordance with the user option
<code>denote-file-name-components-order</code> (<a href="#h:dc8c40e0-233a-4991-9ad3-2cf5f05ef1cd">Change the order of file name components</a>).

<p>
The command <code>denote-dired-rename-files</code> (alias <code>denote-dired-rename-marked-files</code>)
renames the files that are marked in a Dired buffer. Its behaviour is
similar to the <code>denote-rename-file</code> in that it prompts for a title,
keywords, and signature (<a href="#h:7cc9e000-806a-48da-945c-711bbc7426b0">Rename a single file</a>). It does so over each
marked file, renaming one after the other.
</p>

<p>
Unlike <code>denote-rename-file</code>, the command <code>denote-dired-rename-files</code>
does not ask to confirm the changes made to the files: it performs
them outright (same as setting <code>denote-rename-confirmations</code> to a nil
value). This is done to make it easier to rename multiple files
without having to confirm each step. For an even more direct approach,
check the command <code>denote-dired-rename-marked-files-with-keywords</code>.

<p>
The <code>denote-dired-rename-marked-files-with-keywords</code> command renames
marked files in Dired to conform with our file-naming scheme. It does
so by writing keywords to them. Specifically, it does the following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>retains the file&rsquo;s existing name and makes it the <code>TITLE</code> field, per
Denote&rsquo;s file-naming scheme;</li>

<li>sluggifies the <code>TITLE</code> and adjusts its letter casing, according to
our conventions;</li>

<li>prepends an identifier to the <code>TITLE</code>, if one is missing;</li>

<li>preserves the file&rsquo;s extension, if any;</li>

<li>prompts once for <code>KEYWORDS</code> and applies the user&rsquo;s input to the
corresponding field in the file name, rewriting any keywords that
may exist while removing keywords that do exist if <code>KEYWORDS</code> is
empty;</li>

<li>adds or rewrites existing front matter to the underlying file, if it
is recognized as a Denote note (per the <code>denote-file-type</code> user
option), such that it includes the new keywords.</li>
</ul>

<p>
[ Note that the affected buffers are not saved, unless the user option
  <code>denote-rename-no-confirm</code> is non-nil. Users can thus check them to
  confirm that the new front matter does not cause any problems (e.g.
  with the <code>diff-buffer-with-file</code> command). Multiple buffers can be
  saved in one go with the command <code>save-some-buffers</code> (read its doc
  string). ]

<p>
Marked files must count as notes for the purposes of Denote, which
means that they at least have an identifier in their file name and use
a supported file type, per <code>denote-file-type</code>. Files that do not meet
this criterion are ignored, because Denote cannot know if they have
front matter and what that may be. For such files, it is still
possible to rename them interactively (<a href="#h:1b6b2c78-42f0-45b8-9ef0-6de21a8b2cde">Rename multiple files interactively</a>).

<code>denote-file-type</code> options.
</p>

<p>
The conversion does NOT modify the existing front matter.  Instead, it
prepends new front matter to the top of the file.  We do this as a
safety precaution since the user can, in principle, add arbitrary
extras to their front matter that we would not want to touch.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:9051f15d-ea7e-4b17-adc2-bc6a749c721b">
<p>
Denote takes care to create unique identifiers, though its mechanism
relies on reading the existing identifiers in the <code>denote-directory</code>
or the current directory. When we are renaming files across different
directories, there is a small chance that some files have the same
attributes and are thus assigned identical identifiers. If those files
ever make it into a consolidated <code>denote-directory</code>, we will have
duplicates, which break the linking mechanism.
</p>

<p>
As this is an edge case, we do not include any code to address it in
the Denote code base. Though here is a way to find duplicate
identifiers inside the current directory:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(defun my-denote--get-files-in-dir (directory)
  "Return file names in DIRECTORY."
  (directory-files directory :full-paths directory-files-no-dot-files-regexp))

(defun my-denote--same-identifier-p (file1 file2)
  "Return non-nil if FILE1 and FILE2 have the same identifier."
  (let ((id1 (denote-retrieve-filename-identifier file1))
        (id2 (denote-retrieve-filename-identifier file2)))
    (equal id1 id2)))

(defun my-denote-find-duplicate-identifiers (directory)
  "Find all files in DIRECTORY that need a new identifier."
  (let* ((ids (my-denote--get-files-in-dir directory))
         (unique-ids (seq-uniq ids #'my-denote--same-identifier-p)))
    (seq-difference ids unique-ids #'equal)))

(defun my-denote-dired-show-duplicate-identifiers (directory)
  "Put duplicate identifiers from DIRECTORY in a dedicated Dired buffer."
  (interactive
   (list
    (read-directory-name "Select DIRECTORY to check for duplicate identifiers: " default-directory)))
  (if-let* ((duplicates (my-denote-find-duplicate-identifiers directory)))
      (dired (cons (format "Denote duplicate identifiers" directory) duplicates))
    (message "No duplicates identifiers in `%s'" directory)))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Evaluate this code and then call the command <code>my-denote-dired-show-duplicate-identifiers</code>.
If there are duplicates, it will put them in a dedicated Dired buffer.
From there, you can view the file contents as usual, and manually edit
the identifiers as you see fit (e.g. edit them one by one, or change
to the writable Dired and record a keyboard macro that makes use of a
counter to increment by 1&#x2014;contact me if you need any help).

<p>
Notes are stored in the <code>denote-directory</code>.  The default path is
<code>~/Documents/notes</code>.  The <code>denote-directory</code> can be a flat listing,
meaning that it has no subdirectories, or it can be a directory tree.
Either way, Denote takes care to only consider &ldquo;notes&rdquo; as valid
candidates in the relevant operations and will omit other files or
directories.
</p>

<p>
Every note produced by Denote follows this pattern by default
(<a href="#h:17896c8c-d97a-4faa-abf6-31df99746ca6">Points of entry</a>):
</p>

<pre class="example">
DATE==SIGNATURE--TITLE__KEYWORDS.EXTENSION
</pre>


<p>
The <code>DATE</code> field represents the date in year-month-day format followed
by the capital letter <code>T</code> (for &ldquo;time&rdquo;) and the current time in
hour-minute-second notation.  The presentation is compact:
<code>20220531T091625</code>.  The <code>DATE</code> serves as the unique identifier of each
note and, as such, is also known as the file&rsquo;s ID or identifier.
</p>

<p>
File names can include an arbitrary string of alphanumeric characters
in the <code>SIGNATURE</code> field. Signatures have no clearly defined purpose
and are up to the user to define. They can serve as special labels,
such as <code>part1</code> and <code>part2</code> of a large file, or as priority indicators
like <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>c</code>, or even context/scope specifiers like <code>home</code> and
<code>work</code>. Another use-case is to write sequences of thoughts, such that
notes form a hierarchy, something we support with the optional and
comprehensive extension <code>denote-sequence.el</code> (<a href="#h:d5ca722d-e7fa-46fa-9a57-6363b1d4186f">Write sequence notes or &ldquo;folgezettel&rdquo;</a>).
Signatures are an optional extension to Denote&rsquo;s file-naming scheme.
In the simplest form, they can be added to newly created files on
demand, with the command <code>denote-signature</code>, or by modifying the value
of the user option <code>denote-prompts</code> (<a href="#h:f9204f1f-fcee-49b1-8081-16a08a338099">The <code>denote-prompts</code> option</a>).
</p>

<p>
The <code>TITLE</code> field is the title of the note, as provided by the user.
It automatically gets downcased by default and is also hyphenated
(<a href="#h:ae8b19a1-7f67-4258-96b3-370a72c43f4e">Sluggification of file name components</a>).  An entry about &ldquo;Economics
in the Euro Area&rdquo; produces an <code>economics-in-the-euro-area</code> string for
the <code>TITLE</code> of the file name.
</p>

<p>
The <code>KEYWORDS</code> field consists of one or more entries demarcated by an
underscore (the separator is inserted automatically).  Each keyword is
a string provided by the user at the relevant prompt which broadly
describes the contents of the entry.
</p>

<p>
Each of the keywords is a single word, with multiple keywords providing
the multi-dimensionality needed for advanced searches through Denote
files.  Users who need to compose a keyword out of multiple words such
as camelCase/CamelCase and are encouraged to use the
<code>denote-file-name-slug-functions</code> user option accordingly
(<a href="#h:ae8b19a1-7f67-4258-96b3-370a72c43f4e">Sluggification of file name components</a>).
</p>

<p>
The <code>EXTENSION</code> is the file type.  By default, it is <code>.org</code> (<code>org-mode</code>)
though the user option <code>denote-file-type</code> provides support for Markdown
with YAML or TOML variants (<code>.md</code> which runs <code>markdown-mode</code>) and plain
text (<code>.txt</code> via <code>text-mode</code>).  Consult its doc string for the minutiae.
While files end in the <code>.org</code> extension by default, the Denote code base
does not actually depend on org.el and/or its accoutrements.
</p>

<p>
Examples:
</p>

</pre>


<p>
The different field separators, namely <code>--</code> and <code>__</code> introduce an
efficient way to anchor searches (such as with Emacs commands like
<code>isearch</code> or from the command-line with <code>find</code> and related).  A query
for <code>_word</code> always matches a keyword, while a regexp in the form of,
say, <code>"\\([0-9T]+?\\)--\\(.*?\\)_"</code> captures the date in group <code>\1</code> and
the title in <code>\2</code> (test any regular expression in the current buffer by
invoking <code>M-x re-builder</code>).

<a href="#h:1a953736-86c2-420b-b566-fb22c97df197">Features of the file-naming scheme for searching or filtering</a>.
</p>

<p>
The <code>denote-prompts</code> can be configured in such ways to yield the
following file name permutations:
</p>

<pre class="example">
DATE.EXT
DATE--TITLE.EXT
DATE__KEYWORDS.EXT
DATE==SIGNATURE.EXT
DATE==SIGNATURE--TITLE.EXT
DATE==SIGNATURE--TITLE__KEYWORDS.EXT
DATE==SIGNATURE__KEYWORDS.EXT
</pre>


<p>
When in doubt, stick to the default design, which is carefully
considered and works well (<a href="#h:dc8c40e0-233a-4991-9ad3-2cf5f05ef1cd">Change the order of file name components</a>).
</p>

<p>
While Denote is an Emacs package, notes should work long-term and not
depend on the functionality of a specific program.  The file-naming
scheme we apply guarantees that a listing is readable in a variety of
contexts.  The Denote file-naming scheme is, in essence, an effective,
low-tech invention.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:dc8c40e0-233a-4991-9ad3-2cf5f05ef1cd">
<p>
Our standard file-naming scheme prescribes a specific order for the
file name components (<a href="#h:4e9c7512-84dc-4dfb-9fa9-e15d51178e5d">The file-naming scheme</a>). Though we provide the
user option <code>denote-file-name-components-order</code> to let the user
reorder them as they see fit.
</p>

<p>
The value of this user option is a list of the following symbols:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>identifier</code>: This is the combination of the date and time. When it
is the first on the list, it looks like <code>20240519T073456</code> and does
not have a component separator of its own due its unambiguous
format. When it is placed anywhere else in the file name, it is
prefixed with <code>@@</code>, so it looks like <code>@@20240519T073456</code>.</li>

<li><code>signature</code>: This is an arbitrary string that can be used to qualify
the file in some way, according to the user&rsquo;s methodology (e.g. to
add a sequence to notes). The string is always prefixed with the
<code>==</code> to remain unambiguous.</li>

<li><code>title</code>: This is an arbitrary string which describes the file. It is
always prefixed with <code>--</code> to be unambiguous.</li>

<li><code>keywords</code>: This is a series of one or more words that succinctly
group the file. Multiple keywords are separated by an underscore
prefixed to each of them. The file name component is always prefixed
with <code>__</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
All four symbols must appear exactly once. Duplicates are ignored. Any
missing symbol is added automatically.
</p>

<p>
Some examples:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

</p>

<p>
Before deciding on this, please consider the longer-term implications
of file names with varying patterns. Consistency makes things
predictable and thus easier to find. So pick one order and never touch
it again. When in doubt, leave the default file-naming scheme as-is.

<p>
Files names can contain any character that the file system
permits. Denote imposes a few additional restrictions:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The tokens "<code>=", =__</code> and <code>--</code> are interpreted by Denote and should
appear only once.</li>

<li>The dot character is not allowed in a note&rsquo;s file name, except to
indicate the file type extension. Denote recognises two extensions
for encrypted files, like <code>.txt.gpg</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
By default, Denote enforces other rules to file names through the user
option <code>denote-file-name-slug-functions</code>. These rules are applied to
file names by default:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What we count as &ldquo;illegal characters&rdquo; are removed.</li>

<li>Input for a file title is hyphenated.  The original value is
preserved in the note&rsquo;s contents (<a href="#h:13218826-56a5-482a-9b91-5b6de4f14261">Front matter</a>).</li>

<li>Spaces or other delimiters are removed from keywords, meaning that
<code>hello-world</code> becomes <code>helloworld</code>.  This is because hyphens in
keywords do not work everywhere, such as in Org. Plus, hyphens are
word separators in the title and we want to keep distinct separators
for each component to make search easier and semantic
(<a href="#h:1a953736-86c2-420b-b566-fb22c97df197">Features of the file-naming scheme for searching or filtering</a>).</li>

<li>Signatures are like the above, but use the equals sign instead of
hyphens as a word separator.</li>

<li>All file name components are downcased. Further down we document how
to deviate from these rules, such as to accept input of the form
<code>helloWorld</code> or <code>HelloWorld</code> verbatim.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Denote imposes these restrictions to enforce uniformity, which is
helpful long-term as it keeps all files with the same predictable
pattern. Too many permutations make searches more difficult to express
accurately and be confident that the matches cover all files.
Nevertheless, one of the principles of Denote is its flexibility or
hackability and so users can deviate from the aforementioned
(<a href="#h:d375c6d2-92c7-425f-9d9d-219ff47ed2a3">User-defined sluggification of file name components</a>).

<p>
The user option <code>denote-file-name-slug-functions</code> controls the
sluggification of file name components (<a href="#h:ae8b19a1-7f67-4258-96b3-370a72c43f4e">Sluggification of file name components</a>).
The default method is outlined above and in the previous section
(<a href="#h:4e9c7512-84dc-4dfb-9fa9-e15d51178e5d">The file-naming scheme</a>).
</p>

<p>
The value of this user option is an alist where each element is a cons
cell of the form <code>(COMPONENT . METHOD)</code>. For example, here is the
default value:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org09e2a78">
'((title . denote-sluggify-title)
  (signature . denote-sluggify-signature)
  (keyword . denote-sluggify-keyword))
</pre>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The <code>COMPONENT</code> is an unquoted symbol among <code>title</code>, <code>signature</code>,
<code>keyword</code>, which refers to the corresponding component of the file
name.</li>

<li>The <code>METHOD</code> is a function to format the given component. This
function must take a string as its parameter and return the string
formatted for the file name. Note that even in the case of the
<code>keyword</code> component, the function receives one string representing a
single keyword and returns it formatted for the file name. Joining
the keywords together is handled internally by Denote.</li>
</ul>

<p>
One commonly requested deviation from the sluggification rules is to
not sluggify individual keywords, such that the user&rsquo;s input is taken
as-is. This can be done as follows:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(setq denote-file-name-slug-functions
      '((title . denote-sluggify-title)
        (keyword . identity)
        (signature . denote-sluggify-signature)))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The <code>identity</code> function simply returns the string it receives, thus
not altering it in any way.
</p>

<p>
Another approach is to keep the sluggification but not downcase the
string. We can do this by modifying the original functions used by
Denote. For example, we have this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">;; The original function for reference
(defun denote-sluggify-title (str)
  "Make STR an appropriate slug for title."
  (downcase
   (denote-slug-hyphenate
    (replace-regexp-in-string "[][{}!@#$%^&amp;*()+'\"?,.\|;:~`‘’“”/=]*" "" str))))

;; Our variant of the above, which does the same thing except from
;; downcasing the string.
(defun my-denote-sluggify-title (str)
  "Make STR an appropriate slug for title."
  (denote-slug-hyphenate
   (replace-regexp-in-string "[][{}!@#$%^&amp;*()+'\"?,.\|;:~`‘’“”/=]*" "" str)))

;; Now we use our function to sluggify titles without affecting their
;; letter casing.
(setq denote-file-name-slug-functions
      '((title . my-denote-sluggify-title) ; our function here
        (signature . denote-sluggify-signature)
        (keyword . denote-sluggify-keyword)))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Follow this principle for all the sluggification functions (<a href="#h:d1e4eb5b-e7f2-4a3b-9243-e1c653817a4a">Custom sluggification to remove non-ASCII characters</a>).
</p>

<p>
To access the source code, use either of the following built-in
methods:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Call the command <code>find-library</code> and search for <code>denote</code>. Then
navigate to the symbol you are searching for.</li>

<li>Invoke the command <code>describe-symbol</code>, search for the symbol you are
interested in, and from the resulting Help buffer either click on
the first link or do <code>M-x help-view-source</code> (bound to <code>s</code> in Help
buffers, by default).</li>
</ol>

<p>
Remember that deviating from the default file-naming scheme of Denote
will make things harder to use in the future, as files can/will have
permutations that create uncertainty. The sluggification scheme and
concomitant restrictions we impose by default are there for a very
good reason: they are the distillation of years of experience. Here we
give you what you wish, but bear in mind it may not be what you need.
You have been warned.

A common use-case for Denote is to rename files such as videos
downloaded from the Internet. Sometimes, those files have Unicode
characters that (i) not all fonts support and (ii) create all sorts of
problems with pattern matching, such as when searching through file
names.
</p>

<p>
By default, Denote does not remove Unicode characters because users
may actually want them (e.g. Latin characters with accents). Those who
do, however, wish to keep everything limited to the ASCII range can
use the following in their Emacs configuration (<a href="#h:d375c6d2-92c7-425f-9d9d-219ff47ed2a3">User-defined sluggification of file name components</a>).

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:1a953736-86c2-420b-b566-fb22c97df197">
<p>
By default, file names have three fields and two sets of field
delimiters between them:
</p>

<pre class="example">
DATE--TITLE__KEYWORDS.EXTENSION
</pre>


<p>
When a signature is present, this becomes:
</p>

<pre class="example">
DATE==SIGNATURE--TITLE__KEYWORDS.EXTENSION
</pre>


<p>
Field delimiters practically serve as anchors for easier searching.
Consider this example:
</p>

<pre class="example">
20220621T062327==1a2--introduction-to-denote__denote_emacs.txt
</pre>


<p>
You will notice that there are two matches for the word <code>denote</code>: one
in the title field and another in the keywords&rsquo; field.  Because of the
distinct field delimiters, if we search for <code>-denote</code> we only match
the first instance while <code>_denote</code> targets the second one.  When
sorting through your notes, this kind of specificity is
invaluable&#x2014;and you get it for free from the file names alone!
Similarly, a search for <code>=1</code> will show all notes that are related to
each other by virtue of their signature.
</p>

<p>
Users can get a lot of value out of this simple yet effective
arrangement, even if they have no knowledge of regular expressions.
One thing to consider, for maximum effect, is to avoid using
multi-word keywords as those can get hyphenated like the title and
will thus interfere with the above: either set the user option
<code>denote-allow-multi-word-keywords</code> to nil or simply insert single
words at the relevant prompts.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-h:13218826-56a5-482a-9b91-5b6de4f14261">
<p>
Notes have their own &ldquo;front matter&rdquo;.  This is a block of data at the top
of the file, with no empty lines between the entries, which is
automatically generated at the creation of a new note.  The front matter
includes the title and keywords (aka &ldquo;tags&rdquo; or &ldquo;filetags&rdquo;, depending on
the file type) which the user specified at the relevant prompt, as well
as the date and unique identifier, which are derived automatically.
</p>

<p>
This is how it looks for Org mode (when <code>denote-file-type</code> is nil or the
<code>org</code> symbol):
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org0fa2912">
#+title:      This is a sample note
#+date:       [2022-06-30 Thu 16:09]
#+filetags:   :denote:testing:
#+identifier: 20220630T160934
</pre>

<p>
For Markdown with YAML (<code>denote-file-type</code> has the <code>markdown-yaml</code>
value), the front matter looks like this:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org67d5492">
---
title:      "This is a sample note"
date:       2022-06-30T16:09:58+03:00
tags:       ["denote", "testing"]
identifier: "20220630T160958"
---
</pre>

<p>
For Markdown with TOML (<code>denote-file-type</code> has the <code>markdown-toml</code>
value), it is:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org9ebaf8d">
+++
title      = "This is a sample note"
date       = 2022-06-30T16:10:13+03:00
tags       = ["denote", "testing"]
identifier = "20220630T161013"
+++
</pre>

<p>
And for plain text (<code>denote-file-type</code> has the <code>text</code> value), we have
the following:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org528e71e">
title:      This is a sample note
date:       2022-06-30
tags:       denote  testing
identifier: 20220630T161028
---------------------------
</pre>

<p>
The format of the date in the front matter is controlled by the user
option <code>denote-date-format</code>.  When nil, Denote uses a file-type-specific
format:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For Org, an inactive timestamp is used, such as
<code>[2022-06-30 Wed 15:31]</code>.</li>

<li>For Markdown, the RFC3339 standard is applied:
<code>2022-06-30T15:48:00+03:00</code>.</li>

<li>For plain text, the format is that of ISO 8601: <code>2022-06-30</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If the value is a string, ignore the above and use it instead.  The
string must include format specifiers for the date.  These are described
in the doc string of <code>format-time-string</code>..
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-h:7f918854-5ed4-4139-821f-8ee9ba06ad15" class="outline-3">

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:7f918854-5ed4-4139-821f-8ee9ba06ad15">
<p>
Per Denote&rsquo;s design principles, the code is hackable.  All front matter
is stored in variables that are intended for public use.  We do not
declare those as &ldquo;user options&rdquo; because (i) they expect the user to have
some degree of knowledge in Emacs Lisp and (ii) implement custom code.
</p>

<p>
[ NOTE for tinkerers: code intended for internal use includes double
  hyphens in its symbol.  &ldquo;Internal use&rdquo; means that it can be changed
  without warning and with no further reference in the change log.  Do
  not use any of it without understanding the consequences. ]
</p>

<p>
The variables which hold the front matter format are:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>denote-org-front-matter</code></li>
</ul>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>denote-text-front-matter</code></li>
</ul>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>denote-toml-front-matter</code></li>
</ul>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>denote-yaml-front-matter</code></li>
</ul>

<p>
These variables have a string value with specifiers that are used by the
<code>format</code> function.  The formatting operation passes four arguments which
include the values of the given entries.  If you are an advanced user
who wants to edit this variable to affect how front matter is produced,
consider using something like <code>%2$s</code> to control where the Nth argument
is placed.
</p>

<p>
When editing the value, make sure to:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Not use empty lines inside the front matter block.</li>

<li>Insert at least one empty line after the front matter block and do
not use any empty line before it.</li>
</ol>

<p>
These help with consistency and might prove useful if we ever need to
operate on the front matter as a whole.
</p>

<p>
With those granted, below are some examples.  The approach is the same
for all variables.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">;; Like the default, but upcase the entries
(setq denote-org-front-matter
  "#+TITLE:      %s

;; Remove the date and the identifier
(setq denote-org-front-matter
  "#+title:      %1$s

</pre>
</div>

<p>
Note that <code>setq</code> has a global effect: it affects the creation of all new
notes.  Depending on the workflow, it may be preferrable to have a
custom command which <code>let</code> binds the different format.  We shall not
provide examples at this point as this is a more advanced feature and we
are not yet sure what the user&rsquo;s needs are.  Please provide feedback and
we shall act accordingly.

<p>
Denote offers several commands for linking between notes.
</p>

<p>
All links target files which are Denote files. This means that they
have our file-naming scheme. Files need to be inside the
<code>denote-directory</code> or one of its subdirectories. No other file is
recognised.
</p>

<p>
The following sections delve into the details (<a href="#h:4f354db1-aa78-47fd-ac60-c3d1e0f0b0a4">Why are some Org links opening outside Emacs?</a>).

<p>
The <code>denote-link</code> command inserts a link at point to a file specified
at the minibuffer prompt. Links are formatted depending on the file
type of the current note. In Org and plain text buffers, links are
formatted thus: <code>[[denote:IDENTIFIER][DESCRIPTION]]</code>. While in
Markdown they are expressed as <code>[DESCRIPTION](denote:IDENTIFIER)</code>.
</p>

<p>
[ We optionally support links to Org headings (<a href="#h:d99de1fb-b1b7-4a74-8667-575636a4d6a4">The <code>denote-org-store-link-to-heading</code> user option</a>).
  Other file types do not have the features of Org, so we cannot
  generalise this. ]
</p>

<p>
When <code>denote-link</code> is called with a prefix argument (<code>C-u</code> by
default), it formats links like <code>[[denote:IDENTIFIER]]</code>, regardless of
file type (<a href="#h:156c5ea3-147b-4f9d-a404-86a00558c60a">Fontify links in non-Org buffers</a>). The user might prefer
its simplicity.
</p>

<p>
By default, the description of the link is determined thus:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If the region is active, its text becomes the description of the
link. In other words, the region text becomes the link.</li>
<li>If the region is active but has no text, the description is empty
and so the link is formatted the same way as if using the <code>C-u</code>
prefix argument.</li>
<li>If there is no region active, the description consists of the target
file&rsquo;s signature and title, using the former only if it is present.
The title is retrieved either from the front matter or the file
name.</li>
<li>If the target file has no signature, the title is used.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Links are created only for files which qualify as a &ldquo;note&rdquo; for our
purposes (<a href="#h:fc913d54-26c8-4c41-be86-999839e8ad31">Linking notes</a>). Users who need to link to Denote files from
anywhere, can write a simple command to that effect:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(defun my-denote-link-global (file file-type description &amp;optional id-only)
  "Like the `denote-link', but works in any buffer.

  (interactive
   (let* ((file (denote-file-prompt nil "Link to FILE"))
          (file-type (denote-filetype-heuristics buffer-file-name))
          (description (when (file-exists-p file)
                         (denote--link-get-description file))))
     (list file file-type description current-prefix-arg)))
  (unless (file-exists-p file)
    (user-error "The linked file does not exists"))
  (let ((beg (point)))

    (unless (derived-mode-p 'org-mode)
      (make-button beg (point) 'type 'denote-link-button))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Links are styled with the <code>denote-faces-link</code> face, which looks exactly
like an ordinary link by default.  This is just a convenience for the
user/theme in case they want <code>denote:</code> links to remain distinct from
other links.

The user option <code>denote-open-link-function</code> specifies the function
used by Denote to open the file of a link. The default value opens the
file in the other window. Another common value is the function
<code>find-file</code>, which will open the file in the current window. Users may
also specify a function of their choosing.

[ Revised to also support context links that do not use a <code>PROPERTIES</code>
  drawer but which are easier to break. This is done as part of
  3.2.0-dev. ]
</p>

<p>
The user option <code>denote-org-store-link-to-heading</code> determines whether
<code>org-store-link</code> links to the current Org heading.
</p>

<p>
[ Remember that what <code>org-store-link</code> does is merely collect a link.  To
  actually insert it, use the command <code>org-insert-link</code>.  Note that
  <code>org-capture</code> uses <code>org-store-link</code> internally when it needs to store
  a link.  ]
</p>

<p>
When the value is nil, the Denote handler for <code>org-store-link</code> produces
links only to the current file (by using the file&rsquo;s identifier).  For
example:
</p>

<pre class="example">
[[denote:20240118T060608][Some test]]
</pre>


<p>
This is what Denote was doing in versions prior to 2.3.0.
</p>

<p>
If the value is <code>context</code>, the link consists of the file&rsquo;s identifier
and the text of the current heading, like this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
[[denote:20240118T060608::*Heading text][Some test::Heading text]].
</pre>


<p>
However, if there already exists a <code>CUSTOM_ID</code> property for the
current heading, this is always given priority and is used instead of
the context.
</p>

<p>
If the value is <code>id</code> or, for backward-compatibility, any other non-nil
value, then Denote will use the standard Org mechanism of the
<code>CUSTOM_ID</code> property to create a unique link to the heading. If the
heading does not have a <code>CUSTOM_ID</code>, it creates it and includes it in
its <code>PROPERTIES</code> drawer. If a <code>CUSTOM_ID</code> exists, it takes it as-is.
The result is like this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
[[denote:20240118T060608::#h:eed0fb8e-4cc7-478f][Some test::Heading text]]
</pre>


<p>
The value of the <code>CUSTOM_ID</code> is determined by the Org user option
<code>org-id-method</code>. The sample shown above uses the default UUID
infrastructure (though I deleted a few characters to not get
complaints from the byte compiler about long lines in the doc
string&#x2026;).
</p>

<p>
Note that this option does not affect how Org behaves with regard to
<code>org-id-link-to-org-use-id</code>. If that user option is set to create <code>ID</code>
properties, then those will be created by Org even if the Denote link
handler will take care to not use/store the <code>ID</code> value. Concretely,
users who never want <code>ID</code> properties under their headings should keep
<code>org-id-link-to-org-use-id</code> in its nil value.
</p>

<p>
Context links are easier to break than those with a <code>CUSTOM_ID</code> in
cases where either the heading text changes or there is another
heading that matches that text. The potential advantage of context
links is that they do not require a <code>PROPERTIES</code> drawer.
</p>

<p>
When visiting a link to a heading, Org opens the Denote file and then
navigates to that heading.
</p>

<p>
[ This feature only works in Org mode files, as other file types do
  not have a linking mechanism that handles unique identifiers for
  headings or other patterns to jump to. If <code>org-store-link</code> is
  invoked in one such file, it captures only the Denote identifier of
  the file, even if this user option is set to a non-nil value. ]
</p>

<p>
Note that the optional extension <code>denote-org-extras.el</code> defines the command
<code>denote-org-extras-link-to-heading</code>, which always links to a file+heading

<p>
As part of the optional <code>denote-org-extras.el</code> extension, the command
<code>denote-org-extras-link-to-heading</code> prompts for a link to an Org file
and then asks for a heading therein, using minibuffer completion. Once
the user provides input at the two prompts, the command inserts a link
at point which has the following pattern: <code>[[denote:IDENTIFIER::#ORG-HEADING-CUSTOM-ID]][Description::Heading text]]</code>.
</p>

<p>
Because only Org files can have links to individual headings, the
command <code>denote-org-extras-link-to-heading</code> prompts only for Org files
(i.e. files which include the <code>.org</code> extension). Remember that Denote
works with many file types (<a href="#h:4e9c7512-84dc-4dfb-9fa9-e15d51178e5d">The file-naming scheme</a>).
</p>

<p>
This feature is similar to the concept of the user option <code>denote-org-store-link-to-heading</code>
(<a href="#h:d99de1fb-b1b7-4a74-8667-575636a4d6a4">The <code>denote-org-store-link-to-heading</code> user option</a>). It is, however,
interactive and differs in the directionality of the action. With that
user option, the command <code>org-store-link</code> will generate a <code>CUSTOM_ID</code>
for the current heading (or capture the value of one as-is), giving
the user the option to then call <code>org-insert-link</code> wherever they see
fit. By contrast, the command <code>denote-org-extras-link-to-heading</code>
prompts for a file, then a heading, and inserts the link at point.
</p>

<p>
Just as with files, it is possible to show backlinks for the given
heading (<a href="#h:604bf92a-908a-485c-98b8-37ccae559afd">Backlinks for Org headings</a>).

<p>
The command <code>denote-add-links</code> adds links at point matching a
regular expression or plain string.  The links are inserted as a
typographic list, such as:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org569ccfb">
- link1
- link2
- link3
</pre>

<p>
Each link is formatted according to the file type of the current note,
as explained further above about the <code>denote-link</code> command.  The current
note is excluded from the matching entries (adding a link to itself is
pointless).
</p>

<p>
When called with a prefix argument (<code>C-u</code>) <code>denote-add-links</code> will
format all links as <code>[[denote:IDENTIFIER]]</code>, hence a typographic list:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org1883d32">
- [[denote:IDENTIFIER-1]]
- [[denote:IDENTIFIER-2]]
- [[denote:IDENTIFIER-3]]
</pre>

<p>
Same examples of a regular expression that can be used with this
command:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>journal</code> match all files which include <code>journal</code> anywhere in their
name.</li>

<li><code>_journal</code> match all files which include <code>journal</code> as a keyword.</li>

<li><code>^2022.*_journal</code> match all file names starting with <code>2022</code> and
including the keyword <code>journal</code>.</li>

<li><code>\.txt</code> match all files including <code>.txt</code>.  In practical terms, this
only applies to the file extension, as Denote automatically removes
dots (and other characters) from the base file name.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If files are created with <code>denote-sort-keywords</code> as non-nil (the
default), then it is easy to write a regexp that includes multiple
keywords in alphabetic order:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>_denote.*_package</code> match all files that include both the <code>denote</code> and
<code>package</code> keywords, in this order.</li>

<li><code>\(.*denote.*package.*\)\|\(.*package.*denote.*\)</code> is the same as
above, but out-of-order.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Remember that regexp constructs only need to be escaped once (like <code>\|</code>)
when done interactively but twice when called from Lisp.  What we show
above is for interactive usage.
</p>

<p>
Links are created only for files which qualify as a &ldquo;note&rdquo; for our
purposes (<a href="#h:fc913d54-26c8-4c41-be86-999839e8ad31">Linking notes</a>).

The command <code>denote-link-dired-marked-notes</code> is similar to
<code>denote-add-links</code> in that it inserts in the buffer a typographic list
of links to Denote notes (<a href="#h:9bec2c83-36ca-4951-aefc-7187c5463f90">Insert links matching a regexp</a>).  Though
instead of reading a regular expression, it lets the user mark files
in Dired and link to them.  This should be easier for users of all
skill levels, instead of having to write a potentially complex regular
expression.
</p>

<p>
If there are multiple buffers that visit a Denote note, this command
will ask to select one among them, using minibuffer completion.  If
there is only one buffer, it will operate in it outright.  If there are
no buffers, it will produce an error.
</p>

<p>
With optional <code>ID-ONLY</code> as a prefix argument (<code>C-u</code> by default), the
command inserts links with just the identifier, which is the same
principle as with <code>denote-link</code> and others (<a href="#h:5e5e3370-12ab-454f-ba09-88ff44214324">Adding a single link</a>).

In one&rsquo;s note-taking workflow, there may come a point where they are
expounding on a certain topic but have an idea about another subject
they would like to link to (<a href="#h:fc913d54-26c8-4c41-be86-999839e8ad31">Linking notes</a>).  The user can always rely on
the other linking facilities we have covered herein to target files that
already exist.  Though they may not know whether they already have notes
covering the subject or whether they would need to write new ones.  To
this end, Denote provides two convenience commands:
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt><code>denote-link-after-creating</code></dt><dd><p>
Create new note in the background and
link to it directly.
</p>

<p>
Use <code>denote</code> interactively to produce the new note.  Its doc string or
this manual explains which prompts will be used and under what
conditions (<a href="#h:6a92a8b5-d766-42cc-8e5b-8dc255466a23">Standard note creation</a>).
</p>

<p>
With optional <code>ID-ONLY</code> as a prefix argument (this is the <code>C-u</code> key,
by default) create a link that consists of just the identifier.  Else
try to also include the file&rsquo;s title.  This has the same meaning as in
<code>denote-link</code> (<a href="#h:5e5e3370-12ab-454f-ba09-88ff44214324">Adding a single link</a>).
</p>

<p>
IMPORTANT NOTE: Normally, <code>denote</code> does not save the buffer it
produces for the new note (<a href="#h:bf80f4cd-6f56-4f7c-a991-8573161e4511">The <code>denote-save-buffer-after-creation</code> option</a>).
This is a safety precaution to not write to disk unless the user
wants it (e.g. the user may choose to kill the buffer, thus
cancelling the creation of the note). However, for this command the
creation of the note happens in the background and the user may miss
the step of saving their buffer. We thus have to save the buffer in
order to (i) establish valid links, and (ii) retrieve whatever front
matter from the target file.

<p>
The command <code>denote-backlinks</code> produces a bespoke buffer which
displays backlinks to the current note.  A &ldquo;backlink&rdquo; is a link back
to the present entry.
</p>

<p>
By default, the backlinks&rsquo; buffer is designed to display the file name
of the note linking to the current entry.  Each file name is presented
on its own line, like this:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgce09e56">

</pre>

<p>
When the user option <code>denote-backlinks-show-context</code> is non-nil, the
backlinks&rsquo; buffer displays the line on which a link to the current
note occurs.  It also shows multiple occurrences, if present.  It looks
like this (and has the appropriate fontification):

</p>

<p>
Note that the width of the lines in the context depends on the
underlying file.  In the above example, the lines are split at the
<code>fill-column</code>.  Long lines will show up just fine.  Also note that the
built-in user option <code>xref-truncation-width</code> can truncate long lines
to a given maximum number of characters.

<a href="#h:893eec49-d7be-4603-bcff-fcc247244011">Speed up backlinks&rsquo; buffer creation?</a>
</p>

<p>
The backlinks&rsquo; buffer runs the major-mode <code>denote-backlinks-mode</code>.  It
binds keys to move between links with <code>n</code> (next) and <code>p</code> (previous).
These are stored in the <code>denote-backlinks-mode-map</code> (use <code>M-x
describe-mode</code> (<code>C-h m</code>) in an unfamiliar buffer to learn more about
it).  When the user option <code>denote-backlinks-show-context</code> is non-nil,
all relevant Xref key bindings are fully functional: again, check
<code>describe-mode</code>.
</p>

<p>
The backlinking facility uses Emacs&rsquo; built-in Xref infrastructure.  On
some operating systems, the user may need to add certain executables
to the relevant environment variable.

command (<a href="#h:1bc2adad-dca3-4878-b9f0-b105d5dec6f4">Visiting linked files via the minibuffer</a>).

<p>
The placement of the backlinks&rsquo; buffer is subject to the user option

underlying <code>display-buffer</code> mechanism, this inevitably is a relatively
advanced feature. By default, the backlinks&rsquo; buffer is displayed below

sample configuration that places the buffer in a left side window
instead. Reproducing it here for the sake of convenience:

<p>
A &ldquo;metanote&rdquo; is an entry that describes other entries who have something
in common.  Writing metanotes can be part of a workflow where the user
periodically reviews their work in search of patterns and deeper
insights.  For example, you might want to read your journal entries from
the past year to reflect on your experiences, evolution as a person, and
the like.
</p>

<p>
The commands <code>denote-add-links</code>, <code>denote-link-dired-marked-notes</code> are
suited for this task.

</p>

<p>
You will create your metanote the way you use Denote ordinarily
(metanotes may have the <code>metanote</code> keyword, among others), write an
introduction or however you want to go about it, invoke the command
which inserts multiple links at once (see the above-cited nodes), and
continue writing.
</p>

<p>
Metanotes can serve as entry points to groupings of individual notes.
They are not the same as a filtered list of files, i.e. what you would
do in Dired or the minibuffer where you narrow the list of notes to a
given query.  Metanotes contain the filtered list plus your thoughts
about it.  The act of purposefully grouping notes together and
contemplating on their shared patterns is what adds value.
</p>

<p>
Your future self will appreciate metanotes for the function they serve
in encapsulating knowledge, while current you will be equipped with the
knowledge derived from the deliberate self-reflection.

<p>
Denote has a major-mode-agnostic mechanism to collect all linked file
references in the current buffer and return them as an appropriately
formatted list.  This list can then be used in interactive commands.
The <code>denote-find-link</code> is such a command.  It uses minibuffer
completion to visit a file that is linked to from the current note.
The candidates have the correct metadata, which is ideal for
integration with other standards-compliant tools (<a href="#h:8ed2bb6f-b5be-4711-82e9-8bee5bb06ece">Extending Denote</a>).
For instance, a package such as <code>marginalia</code> will display accurate
annotations, while the <code>embark</code> package will be able to work its magic
such as in exporting the list into a filtered Dired buffer (i.e. a
familiar Dired listing with only the files of the current minibuffer
session).
</p>

<p>
To visit backlinks to the current note via the minibuffer, use
<code>denote-find-backlink</code>.  This is an alternative to placing backlinks

Sometimes the user needs to translate all <code>denote:</code> link types to
their <code>file:</code> equivalent. This may be because some other tool does not
recognise <code>denote:</code> links (or other custom links types&#x2014;which are a
standard feature of Org, by the way). The user thus needs to (i)
either make a copy of their Denote note or edit the existing one, and
(ii) convert all links to the generic <code>file:</code> link type that

<p>
Although Markdown is a ubiquitous file format, there is no
standardised way to extend its link facility. This means that we
cannot reliably make <code>denote:</code> links work in applications outside of
Emacs. Though users will likely need this feature for interoperability.
</p>

<p>
All we can do is provide commands which convert links from the
<code>denote:</code> type to a relative or absolute file path, and vice versa:
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Convert <code>denote:</code> links to file paths</dt><dd>The command
<code>denote-md-extras-convert-links-to-file-paths</code> runs through the
current Markdown file and converts every instance of a <code>denote:</code>

this link <code>[Test description](denote:20241026T051243)</code> expands to
the file <code>20241026T051243--test-description__denote_testing.md</code>.
When <code>denote-md-extras-convert-links-to-file-paths</code> is called with a
prefix argument (<code>C-u</code> by default), it produces absolute file system
paths.</dd>
</dl>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Convert file paths links to <code>denote:</code></dt><dd>The command
<code>denote-md-extras-convert-links-to-denote-type</code> is the inverse of
the above. It finds all the file paths , be they relative or
absolute, and converts them into their corresponding <code>denote:</code> style
links. It only does so for files with a Denote identifier.</dd>
</dl>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Convert <code>denote:</code> links to Obsidian type</dt><dd>The command
<code>denote-md-extras-convert-links-to-obsidian-type</code> changes links from

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:156c5ea3-147b-4f9d-a404-86a00558c60a">
<p>
Denote links are automatically fontified in Org buffers (<a href="#h:5e5e3370-12ab-454f-ba09-88ff44214324">Adding a single link</a>).
This means that Org recognises the link and applies the relevant
properties to it to make it clickable/actionable. Other major modes,
such as <code>markdown-mode</code> (for <code>.md</code> files) or <code>text-mode</code> (for <code>.txt</code>
files) do not have this feature built into them. Users can still get
the same behaviour as with Org by activating the <code>denote-fontify-links-mode</code>.
</p>

<p>
The <code>denote-fontify-links-mode</code> is a buffer-local minor mode. Users can enable
it automatically in plain text files that correspond to denote notes with
something like this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(add-hook 'text-mode-hook #'denote-fontify-links-mode-maybe)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The <code>text-mode-hook</code> applies to all modes derived from <code>text-mode</code>, including
<code>markdown-mode</code>. Though a more explicit setup does no harm:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(add-hook 'markdown-mode-hook #'denote-fontify-links-mode-maybe)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Because Org already recognises <code>denote:</code> links, the function
<code>denote-fontify-links-mode-maybe</code> will not enable the mode
<code>denote-fontify-links-mode</code> in Org buffers.
</p>

<p>
In files whose major mode is <code>markdown-mode</code>, the default key binding
<code>C-c C-o</code> (which calls the command <code>markdown-follow-thing-at-point</code>)
correctly resolves <code>denote:</code> links. Interested users can refer to the
function <code>denote-link-markdown-follow</code> for the implementation details.

[ As part of 3.2.0-dev, the old user option
  <code>denote-link-description-function</code> is deprecated and superseded by
  the new <code>denote-link-description-format</code>. The new user option still
  accepts a custom function as its value, so the old behaviour should
  be retained. ]
</p>

<p>
The user option <code>denote-link-description-format</code> controls how the
command <code>denote-link</code> and related functions create a link description
by default.
</p>

<p>
The value can be either a function or a string. If it is a function,
it is called with one argument, the file, and should return a string
representing the link description.
</p>

<p>
The default is a function that returns the active region or the title of
the note (with the signature if present).
</p>

<p>
If the value is a string, it treats specially the following specifiers:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The <code>%t</code> is the Denote <code>TITLE</code> in the front matter or the file name.</li>
<li>The <code>%T</code> is the Denote <code>TITLE</code> in the file name.</li>
<li>The <code>%i</code> is the Denote <code>IDENTIFIER</code> of the file.</li>
<li>The <code>%d</code> is the same as <code>%i</code> (<code>DATE</code> mnemonic).</li>
<li>The <code>%s</code> is the Denote <code>SIGNATURE</code> of the file.</li>
<li>The <code>%k</code> is the Denote <code>KEYWORDS</code> of the file.</li>
<li>The <code>%%</code> is a literal percent sign.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In addition, the following flags are available for each of the specifiers:
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>0</dt><dd>Pad to the width, if given, with zeros instead of spaces.</dd>
<dt>-</dt><dd>Pad to the width, if given, on the right instead of the left.</dd>

Any other text in the string it taken as-is. Users may want, for

<p>
The user option <code>denote-commands-for-new-notes</code> specifies a list of
commands that are available at the <code>denote-command-prompt</code>.  This
prompt is used by Denote commands that ask the user how to create a
new note, as described elsewhere in this manual:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="#h:ad91ca39-cf10-4e16-b224-fdf78f093883">Open an existing note or create it if missing</a></li>

(<a href="#h:17896c8c-d97a-4faa-abf6-31df99746ca6">Points of entry</a>).  Users may customise this value if (i) they only

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-h:337f9cf0-9f66-45af-b73f-f6370472fb51">
<p>
One of the upsides of Denote&rsquo;s file-naming scheme is the predictable
pattern it establishes, which appears as a near-tabular presentation in
a listing of notes (i.e. in Dired).  The <code>denote-dired-mode</code> can help
enhance this impression, by fontifying the components of the file name
to make the date (identifier) and keywords stand out.
</p>

<p>
There are two ways to set the mode.  Either use it for all directories,
which probably is not needed:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(add-hook 'dired-mode-hook #'denote-dired-mode)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Or configure the user option <code>denote-dired-directories</code> and then set up
the function <code>denote-dired-mode-in-directories</code>:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">;; We use different ways to specify a path for demo purposes.
(setq denote-dired-directories
      (list denote-directory
            (thread-last denote-directory (expand-file-name "attachments"))
            (expand-file-name "~/Documents/vlog")))

(add-hook 'dired-mode-hook #'denote-dired-mode-in-directories)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The user option <code>denote-dired-directories-include-subdirectories</code>
specifies whether the <code>denote-dired-directories</code> also cover their
subdirectories. By default they do not. Set this option to <code>t</code> to
include subdirectories as well.
</p>

<p>
The faces we define for this purpose are:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>denote-faces-date</code></li>
<li><code>denote-faces-delimiter</code></li>
<li><code>denote-faces-extension</code></li>
<li><code>denote-faces-keywords</code></li>
<li><code>denote-faces-signature</code></li>
<li><code>denote-faces-subdirectory</code></li>
<li><code>denote-faces-time</code></li>
<li><code>denote-faces-title</code></li>
</ul>

<p>
For more control, we also provide these:
</p>

<p>
#+vindex denote-faces-year
#+vindex denote-faces-month
#+vindex denote-faces-day
#+vindex denote-faces-hour
#+vindex denote-faces-minute
#+vindex denote-faces-second

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>denote-faces-year</code></li>

<li><code>denote-faces-day</code></li>
<li><code>denote-faces-hour</code></li>
<li><code>denote-faces-minute</code></li>
<li><code>denote-faces-second</code></li>
</ul>

<p>
For the time being, the <code>diredfl</code> package is not compatible with this
facility.
</p>

<p>
The <code>denote-dired-mode</code> does not only fontify note files that were
created by Denote: it covers every file name that follows our naming
conventions (<a href="#h:4e9c7512-84dc-4dfb-9fa9-e15d51178e5d">The file-naming scheme</a>).  This is particularly useful for
scenaria where, say, one wants to organise their collection of PDFs and
multimedia in a systematic way (and, perhaps, use them as attachments
for the notes Denote produces if you are writing Org notes and are using
its standand attachments&rsquo; facility).

<p>
Buffers are named by applying the function specified in the user
option <code>denote-rename-buffer-function</code>. The default function is
<code>denote-rename-buffer</code>: it renames the buffer based on the template
set in the user option <code>denote-rename-buffer-format</code>. By default, the
formatting template targets only the <code>TITLE</code> component of the file
name (<a href="#h:4e9c7512-84dc-4dfb-9fa9-e15d51178e5d">The file-naming scheme</a>). Other fields are explained elsewhere in
this manual (<a href="#h:35507c18-35b1-41b9-9d80-52f54fcef3cb">The denote-rename-buffer-format</a>).

(<a href="#h:532e8e2a-9b7d-41c0-8f4b-3c5cbb7d4dca">Renaming files</a>). The former is just for convenience inside of Emacs.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-h:8b542c50-dcc9-4bca-8037-a36599b22779">
<p>
[ As part of version 2.3.0, all dynamic blocks are defined in the file
  <code>denote-org-extras.el</code>. The file which was once called
  <code>denote-org-dblock.el</code> contains aliases for the new function names
  and displays a warning about its deprecation. There is no need to
  <code>require</code> the <code>denote-org-extras</code> feature because all of Denote&rsquo;s
  Org dynamic blocks are autoloaded (meaning that they work as soon as
  they are used). For backward compatibility, all dynamic blocks
  retain their original names as an alias for the newer one. ]
</p>

<p>
Denote can optionally integrate with Org mode&rsquo;s &ldquo;dynamic blocks&rdquo;
facility. This means that it can use special blocks that are evaluated
with <code>C-c C-x C-u</code> (<code>org-dblock-update</code>) to generate their contents.
The following subsections describe the types of Org dynamic blocks
provided by Denote.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="#h:50160fae-6515-4d7d-9737-995ad925e64b">Org dynamic blocks to insert links or backlinks</a></li>
<li><a href="#h:f15fa143-5036-416f-9bff-1bcabbb03456">Org dynamic block to insert file contents</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
A dynamic block gets its contents by evaluating a function that
corresponds to the type of block. The block type and its parameters
are stated in the opening <code>#+BEGIN</code> line. Typing <code>C-c C-x C-u</code>
(<code>org-dblock-update</code>) with point on that line runs (or re-runs) the
associated function with the given parameters and populates the
block&rsquo;s contents accordingly.
</p>

<p>
Dynamic blocks are particularly useful for metanote entries that
reflect on the status of earlier notes (<a href="#h:6060a7e6-f179-4d42-a9de-a9968aaebecc">Writing metanotes</a>).

The <code>denote-links</code> block can be inserted at point with the command
<code>denote-org-extras-dblock-insert-links</code> or by manually including the
following in an Org file:
</p>

<pre class="example">
#+BEGIN: denote-links :regexp "YOUR REGEXP HERE" :not-regexp :excluded-dirs-regexp nil :sort-by-component nil :reverse-sort nil :id-only nil :include-date nil

#+END:

All the parameters except for <code>:regexp</code> are optional.

The <code>denote-links</code> block is also registered as an option for the

<p>
Type <code>C-c C-x C-u</code> (<code>org-dblock-update</code>) with point on the <code>#+BEGIN</code>
line to update the block.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The <code>:regexp</code> parameter is mandatory. Its value is a string and its
behaviour is the same as that of the <code>denote-add-links</code> command
(<a href="#h:9bec2c83-36ca-4951-aefc-7187c5463f90">Insert links matching a regexp</a>). Concretely, it produces a
typographic list of links to files matching the giving regular
expression. The value of the <code>:regexp</code> parameter may also be of the
form read by the <code>rx</code> macro (Lisp notation instead of a string), as
explained in the Emacs Lisp Reference Manual (evaluate this code to
read the documentation: <code>(info "(elisp) Rx Notation")</code>). Note that
you do not need to write an actual regular expression to get
meaningful results: even something like <code>_journal</code> will work to
include all files that have a <code>journal</code> keyword.</li>

<li>The <code>:not-regexp</code> parameter is optional. It is a regular expression
that applies after <code>:regexp</code> to filter out the matching files. [
Part of 3.2.0-dev. ]</li>

<li>The <code>:excluded-dirs-regexp</code> is a string that contains a word or
regular expression that matches against directory files names
to-be-excluded from the results. This has the same meaning as
setting the <code>denote-excluded-directories-regexp</code> user option
(<a href="#h:8458f716-f9c2-4888-824b-2bf01cc5850a">Exclude certain directories from all operations</a>). The user option
has a global effect, which is overridden locally in the dynamic
block. When the value of <code>:excluded-dirs-regexp</code> is nil (the
default), the value of <code>denote-excluded-directories-regexp</code> is used
(which is also nil by default, meaning that all directories are
included). When the value of <code>excluded-dirs-regexp</code> is <code>t</code> or some
other symbol, then the <code>denote-excluded-directories-regexp</code> is
ignored altogether. This is useful in the scenario where the user
option is set to exclude some directories but the dynamic blocks
wants to lift that restriction.</li>

<li>The <code>:sort-by-component</code> parameter is optional. It sorts the files
by the given Denote file name component. The value it accepts is an
unquoted symbol among <code>title</code>, <code>keywords</code>, <code>signature</code>, <code>identifier</code>.
When using the command <code>denote-org-extras-dblock-insert-files</code>, this
parameter is automatically inserted together with the (<code>:regexp</code>
parameter) and the user is prompted for a file name component.</li>

<li>The <code>:reverse-sort</code> parameter is optional. It reverses the order in
which files appear in. This is meaningful even without the presence
of the parameter <code>:sort-by-component</code>, though it also combines with
it.</li>

<li>The <code>:id-only</code> parameter is optional. It accepts a <code>t</code> value, in
which case links are inserted without a description text but only
with the identifier of the given file. This has the same meaning as
with the <code>denote-link</code> command and related facilities (<a href="#h:fc913d54-26c8-4c41-be86-999839e8ad31">Linking notes</a>).</li>

<li>The <code>:include-date</code> parameter controls whether to display the date
of the file name after the title. This is done when its value is
<code>t</code>. By default (a nil value), no date is shown.</li>

<li>An optional <code>:block-name</code> parameter can be specified with a string
value to add a <code>#+name</code> to the results. This is useful for further
processing using Org facilities (a feature that is outside Denote&rsquo;s
purview).</li>

In some workflows, users may want to have a separate block to see what
other links they are missing since they last updated the dynamic
block. We cover that case as well (<a href="#h:1a81e255-0510-4ee0-bc3a-374de048ef46">The Org dynamic block to insert missing links only</a>).

The <code>denote-missing-links</code> block is available with the command
<code>denote-org-extras-dblock-insert-missing-links</code>. It is like the
aforementioned <code>denote-links</code> block, except it only lists links to
files that are not present in the current buffer (<a href="#h:50160fae-6515-4d7d-9737-995ad925e64b">Org dynamic blocks to insert links</a>).

<p>
Apart from links to files matching a regular expression, we can also
produce a list of backlinks to the current file. The dynamic block can
be inserted at point with the command <code>denote-org-extras-dblock-insert-backlinks</code>
or by manually writing this in an Org file:
</p>

<pre class="example">

Remember to type <code>C-c C-x C-u</code> (<code>org-dblock-update</code>) with point on the

The parameters recognised by this dynamic block are almost the same as
that for inserting links (<a href="#h:50160fae-6515-4d7d-9737-995ad925e64b">Org dynamic blocks to insert links</a>). They
are all optional in this case and there is no parameter expecting a
regular expression for matching files to link to.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, the <code>denote-backlinks</code> block also recognises the
<code>:this-heading-only</code> parameter. It determines if the backlinks are
about the file or the heading under which the dynamic block is inserted
(<a href="#h:604bf92a-908a-485c-98b8-37ccae559afd">Backlinks for Org headings</a>). When this parameter is omitted or nil
(the default), then the backlinks are about the whole file, but if
this parameter has a <code>t</code> value then the backlinks are specifically for
the heading (<a href="#h:fc1ad245-ec08-41be-8d1e-7153d99daf02">Insert link to an Org file with a further pointer to a heading</a>).

Denote can optionally use Org&rsquo;s dynamic blocks facility to produce a
section that lists entire file contents (<a href="#h:8b542c50-dcc9-4bca-8037-a36599b22779">Use Org dynamic blocks</a>).
This works by instructing Org to match a regular expression of Denote
files, the same way we do with Denote links (<a href="#h:9bec2c83-36ca-4951-aefc-7187c5463f90">Insert links matching a regexp</a>).
</p>

<p>
This is useful to, for example, compile a dynamically concatenated
list of scattered thoughts on a given topic, like <code>^2023.*_emacs</code> for
a long entry that incorporates all the notes written in 2023 with the
keyword <code>emacs</code>.
</p>

<p>
To produce such a block, call the command <code>denote-org-extras-dblock-insert-files</code>
or manually write the following block in an Org file and then type
 <code>C-c C-x C-u</code> (<code>org-dblock-update</code>) on the <code>#+BEGIN</code> line to run it
(do it again to recalculate the block):
</p>

<pre class="example">
#+BEGIN: denote-files :regexp "YOUR REGEXP HERE" :not-regexp nil :sort-by-component nil :reverse-sort nil :no-front-matter nil :file-separator nil :add-links nil

Remember to type <code>C-c C-x C-u</code> (<code>org-dblock-update</code>) with point on the
<code>#+BEGIN</code> line to update the block.
</p>

<p>
To fully control the output, include these additional optional
parameters, which are described further below:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The <code>:regexp</code> parameter is mandatory. Its value is a string,
representing a regular expression to match Denote file names. Its
value may also be an <code>rx</code> expression instead of a string, as noted
in the previous section (<a href="#h:50160fae-6515-4d7d-9737-995ad925e64b">Org dynamic blocks to insert links or backlinks</a>).
Note that you do not need to write an actual regular expression to
get meaningful results: even something like <code>_journal</code> will work to

<li>The <code>:not-regexp</code> parameter is optional. It is a regular expression
that applies after <code>:regexp</code> to filter out the matching files. [

<li>The <code>:excluded-dirs-regexp</code> is a string that contains a word or
regular expression that matches against directory files names
to-be-excluded from the results. This has the same meaning as
setting the <code>denote-excluded-directories-regexp</code> user option
(<a href="#h:8458f716-f9c2-4888-824b-2bf01cc5850a">Exclude certain directories from all operations</a>). The user option
has a global effect, which is overridden locally in the dynamic
block. When the value of <code>:excluded-dirs-regexp</code> is nil (the
default), the value of <code>denote-excluded-directories-regexp</code> is used
(which is also nil by default, meaning that all directories are
included). When the value of <code>excluded-dirs-regexp</code> is <code>t</code> or some
other symbol, then the <code>denote-excluded-directories-regexp</code> is
ignored altogether. This is useful in the scenario where the user
option is set to exclude some directories but the dynamic blocks
wants to lift that restriction.</li>

<li>The <code>:sort-by-component</code> parameter is optional. It sorts the files
by the given Denote file name component. The value it accepts is an
unquoted symbol among <code>title</code>, <code>keywords</code>, <code>signature</code>, <code>identifier</code>.
When using the command <code>denote-org-extras-dblock-insert-files</code>, this
parameter is automatically inserted together with the (<code>:regexp</code>
parameter) and the user is prompted for a file name component.</li>

<li>The <code>:reverse-sort</code> parameter is optional. It reverses the order in
which files appear in. This is meaningful even without the presence
of the parameter <code>:sort-by-component</code>, though it also combines with
it.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The <code>:file-separator</code> parameter is optional. If it is omitted, then
Denote will use no separator between the files it inserts. If the
value is <code>t</code> the <code>denote-org-extras-dblock-file-contents-separator</code> is
applied at the end of each file: it introduces some empty lines and
a horizontal rule between them to visually distinguish individual
files. If the <code>:file-separator</code> value is a string, it is used as the
file separator (e.g. use <code>"\n"</code> to insert just one empty new line).</li>

<li>The <code>:no-front-matter</code> parameter is optional. When set to a <code>t</code>
value, Denote tries to remove front matter from the files it is
inserting in the dynamic block. The technique used to perform this
operation is by removing all lines from the top of the file until
the first empty line. This works with the default front matter that
Denote adds, but is not 100% reliable with all sorts of user-level
modifications and edits to the file. When the <code>:no-front-matter</code> is
set to a natural number, Denote will omit that many lines from the
top of the file.</li>

<li>The <code>:add-links</code> parameter is optional. When it is set to a <code>t</code>
value, all files are inserted as a typographic list and are indented
accordingly. The first line in each list item is a link to the file
whose contents are inserted in the following lines. When the value
is <code>id-only</code>, then links are inserted without a description text but
only with the identifier of the given file. This has the same
meaning as with the <code>denote-link</code> command and related facilities
(<a href="#h:fc913d54-26c8-4c41-be86-999839e8ad31">Linking notes</a>). Remember that Org can fold the items in a
typographic list the same way it does with headings. So even long
files can be presented in this format without much trouble.</li>

<li>An optional <code>:block-name</code> parameter can be specified with a string
value to add a <code>#+name</code> to the results. This is useful for further
processing using Org facilities (a feature that is outside Denote&rsquo;s
purview).</li>

<p>
As a variation of the previously covered block that inserts file
contents, we have the <code>denote-org-extras-dblock-insert-files-as-headings</code>
command (<a href="#h:f15fa143-5036-416f-9bff-1bcabbb03456">Org dynamic block to insert file contents</a>). It Turn the

all original headings in the file by one, so that they become
subheadings of what once was the <code>#+title</code>. Similarly, the
<code>#+filetags</code> of each file as tags for the top-level heading
(what was the <code>#+title</code>).
</p>

<p>
Because of how it is meant to work, this dynamic block only works with
Org files.

In its simplest form, this dynamic block looks like this, with
<code>:regexp</code> as the only mandatory parameter:

<p>
This section is about the optional extension <code>denote-sequence.el</code>,
which is part of the <code>denote</code> package. Its commands are autoloaded, so
they are avaialble in the <code>M-x</code> interface at the outset and will load
their file when they are invoked. Though users can explicitly load
the file on demand with:

<div class="org-src-container">

<p>
Denote defines an optional file name component called the <code>SIGNATURE</code>
(<a href="#h:4e9c7512-84dc-4dfb-9fa9-e15d51178e5d">The file-naming scheme</a>). This is a free form field that users can
fill in with whatever text they want, such as to have a video split up
into <code>part1</code> and <code>part2</code>, or to set some kind of priority like <code>a</code> and
<code>b</code>, or even to have a special tag that stands out from the rest of
the keywords.
</p>

<p>
A more specialised use-case of the <code>SIGNATURE</code> is to define a
hierarchical relationship between notes, such that the thoughts they
expound on form sequences. For example, an article about the Labrador
Retriever dog breed is a continuation of a thought process that
extends something about dog breeds in general which, in turn, is a
topic that belongs to the wider theme of dogs. A sequence, then, is a
representation of such relationships. A note with a <code>SIGNATURE</code> of
<code>1=1</code> (the <code>=</code> is the field separator of signatures, per the Denote
file-naming scheme) is thus the first child of note <code>1</code> and the
sibling of note <code>1=2</code>. In this regard, something unrelated to dogs
will be its own parent, such as <code>2</code>, and so on.
</p>

<p>
All the relevant functions we provide take care to automatically use
the right number for a given sequence (<a href="#h:6293ec17-05ef-4e41-9ae3-25df2ad86303">Create parent, child, or sibling sequence notes</a>).
If, for example, we create a new child of parent <code>1=1</code>, we make sure
that it is the largest number among any existing children, so if
<code>1=1=1</code> already exists we use <code>1=1=2</code>, and the like.
</p>

<p>
The <code>denote-sequence.el</code> optional extension is not necessary for such
a workflow. Users can always define whatever <code>SIGNATURE</code> they want
manually. The purpose of this extension is to streamline this work.

scheme, which is <code>1a2</code> for the same sequence (<a href="#h:373710df-a62e-4400-961c-87fac019b0a0">Convert from one sequencing scheme to another</a>):

<dt>Numeric sequencing scheme</dt><dd>A numeric sequence consists only of
numbers. The level of depth is derived from the number of fields in
the sequence, separated by the equals sign. Thus, the sequence
<code>1=1=2</code> consists of three levels of depth. For deeper sequences, the
numeric scheme will get longer, which some users may consider
unwieldy. The upside, however, is that is easier to reason about
larger numbers, such as <code>1=100=2=50</code>.</dd>

<dt>Alphanumeric sequencing scheme</dt><dd>An alphanumeric sequence combines
numbers and letters. The level of depth is undestand by the
alteration from numbers to letters and vice versa. As such, the
sequence <code>1a2</code> has three levels of depth. This scheme is more
compact, which users may like but can be harder to reason about
large numbers, such as <code>1zzzv2zx</code> corresponding to the numeric

While reading a file with a sequence, you may want to find what its
relatives are about. To this end, the command <code>denote-sequence-find</code>
prompts for a type among <code>parent</code>, <code>sibling</code>, <code>child</code>, and then asks
to select a file among those matching the given type. It then visits
the file.

example, <code>1=1=2</code> is three levels of depth. It is possible to use an
empty string at the prefix prompt to not limit the results to any

The <code>denote-sort.el</code> file is an optional extension to the core
functionality of Denote, which empowers users to sort files by the
given file name component (<a href="#h:4e9c7512-84dc-4dfb-9fa9-e15d51178e5d">The file-naming scheme</a>).
</p>

<p>
The command <code>denote-sort-dired</code> produces a Dired file listing with a
flat, filtered, and sorted set of files from the <code>denote-directory</code>
(<a href="#h:c958e087-1d23-4a25-afdd-db7bf5606b4c">Define a sorting function per component</a>). It does so by a series of
prompts, which can be configured by the user option
<code>denote-sort-dired-extra-prompts</code> (<a href="#h:a34228cb-484f-48fe-9cbc-8e41f313127b">Configure what extra prompts <code>denote-sort-dired</code> issues</a>).
</p>

<p>
The out-of-the-box behaviour of <code>denote-sort-dired</code> is as follows:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>It first asks for a regular expression with which to match Denote
files. Remember that due to Denote&rsquo;s efficient file-naming scheme,
you do not need to write some complex regular expression. Even
something like <code>_journal</code> will match only files with a <code>journal</code>
keyword.</li>
<li>Once the regular expression is provided, the command asks for a
Denote file name component to sort files by. This is a symbol among
<code>title</code>, <code>keywords</code>, <code>signature</code>, and <code>identifier</code>.</li>
<li>Finally, it asks a &ldquo;yes or no&rdquo; on whether to reverse the sort
order.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The resulting Dired listing is a regular Dired buffer, unlike that of
<code>dired-virtual-mode</code> (<a href="#h:d35d8d41-f51b-4139-af8f-9c8cc508e35b">Use <code>dired-virtual-mode</code> for arbitrary file listings</a>).
</p>

<p>
The dynamic Org blocks that Denote defines to insert file contents
also use this feature (<a href="#h:f15fa143-5036-416f-9bff-1bcabbb03456">Org dynamic block to insert file contents</a>).

<p>
By default, the <code>denote-sort-dired</code> command prompts for (i) a query to
match file names, (ii) a file name component to sort by, and (iii)
whether to reverse the sorting. Users can configure the latter two by
modifying the user option <code>denote-sort-dired-extra-prompts</code>.
</p>

<p>
It accepts either a nil value or a list of symbols among
<code>sort-by-component</code>, <code>reverse-sort</code>, and <code>exclude-regexp</code>. The order
those symbols appear in the list is significant, with the leftmost
coming first. [ The <code>exclude-regexp</code> feature is part of
3.2.0-dev. ]
</p>

<p>
These symbols correspond to the following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A choice to select the file name component to sort by.</li>
<li>A yes or no prompt on whether to reverse the sorting.</li>
<li>A string (or regular expression) of files to be excluded from the
results.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In case of a nil value, those extra prompts will not happen, meaning
that <code>denote-sort-dired</code> will fall back to using
<code>denote-sort-dired-default-sort-component</code> and
<code>denote-sort-dired-default-reverse-sort</code>.

<p>
When sorting by <code>title</code>, <code>keywords</code>, or <code>signature</code> with the

function that is specific to each component. These are subject to user
configuration:
</p>

namely <code>string-collate-lessp</code>. Users who have specific needs for any
of those file name components can write their own sorting algorithms
(<a href="#h:95345870-4ccd-484f-9adf-de4747ad5760">Sort signatures that include Luhmann-style sequences</a>).

</p>

<p>
Niklas Luhmann would edit notes to form sequences of thoughts with
branching paths, such as <code>1.1</code>, <code>1.1a</code>, <code>1.2</code>, <code>1.2a</code>, <code>1.2b</code>, etc.
With the Denote file-naming scheme, we make the word separator in each
file name component use the same character as the entire field, so
words in a title have a dash between them and signatures have the
equals sign (<a href="#h:4e9c7512-84dc-4dfb-9fa9-e15d51178e5d">The file-naming scheme</a>). Thus, our Luhmann-style
signature will be slightly different in their looks: <code>1=1</code>, <code>1=1a</code>,
<code>1=2</code>, <code>1=2a</code>, <code>1=2b</code>.
</p>

<p>
When using the <code>denote-sort-dired</code> command with default settings, our
signatures will not sort in an intuitive way. This is because they
combine numbers and letters, which require a different approach than
what the default sorting function is using (<a href="#h:c958e087-1d23-4a25-afdd-db7bf5606b4c">Define a sorting function per component</a>).

<p>
Denote provides a general-purpose mechanism to create new files that
broadly count as &ldquo;notes&rdquo; (<a href="#h:17896c8c-d97a-4faa-abf6-31df99746ca6">Points of entry</a>).  Such files can be daily
entries in a journal.  While it is possible to use the generic
<code>denote</code> command to maintain a journal, we provide an optional set of
convenience options and commands as part of <code>denote-journal-extras.el</code>.
To use those, add the following the Denote configuration:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(require 'denote-journal-extras)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The command <code>denote-journal-extras-new-entry</code> creates a new entry in
the journal. Such a file has the <code>denote-journal-extras-keyword</code>,
which is <code>journal</code> by default (<a href="#h:4e9c7512-84dc-4dfb-9fa9-e15d51178e5d">The file-naming scheme</a>). The user can
set this keyword to an arbitrary string (single word is preferred) or
a list of string (the support for a list of strings is part of
3.2.0-dev). New journal entries can be stored in the
<code>denote-directory</code> or subdirectory thereof. To make it easier for the
user, the new journal entry will be placed in <code>denote-journal-extras-directory</code>,
which defaults to a subdirectory of <code>denote-directory</code> called <code>journal</code>.
</p>

<p>
If <code>denote-journal-extras-directory</code> is nil, the <code>denote-directory</code> is
used.  Journal entries will thus be in a flat listing together with
all other notes.  They can still be retrieved easily by searching for
the <code>denote-journal-extras-keyword</code> (<a href="#h:1a953736-86c2-420b-b566-fb22c97df197">Features of the file-naming scheme for searching or filtering</a>).
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, the command <code>denote-journal-extras-new-entry</code> will use
the current date as the title of the new entry.  The exact format is
controlled by the user option <code>denote-journal-extras-title-format</code>.
Acceptable values for <code>denote-journal-extras-title-format</code> and their
corresponding styles are:

</div>

<p>
If the value of this user option is <code>nil</code>, then
<code>denote-journal-extras-new-entry</code> will prompt for a title.
</p>

<p>
The <code>denote-journal-extras-new-entry</code> command also accepts an optional
<code>DATE</code> argument. When called internactively, this is a universal
prefix (e.g. <code>C-u</code> with the default key bindings). With <code>DATE</code>, it
prompts for a date to create a new journal entry for. The date prompt
can optionally use the Org date+calendar selection interface
(<a href="#h:e7ef08d6-af1b-4ab3-bb00-494a653e6d63">The <code>denote-date-prompt-use-org-read-date</code> option</a>).
</p>

<p>
In terms of workflow, using the current date as the title is better
for maintaining a daily journal.  A prompt for an arbitrary title is
more suitable for those who like to keep a record of something like a
thought or event (though this can also be achieved by the regular
<code>denote</code> command or maybe <code>denote-subdirectory</code>).
</p>

<p>
The <code>denote-journal-extras-new-entry</code> command calls the normal hook
<code>denote-journal-extras-hook</code> after it is done.  The user can leverage
this to produce consequences therefrom, such as to set a timer with
the <code>tmr</code> package from GNU ELPA (<a href="#h:4af1f81e-e93a-43cc-b344-960032a16d42">Journaling with a timer</a>).
</p>

<p>
The command <code>denote-journal-extras-new-or-existing-entry</code> locates an
existing journal entry or creates a new one. A journal entry is one
that has <code>denote-journal-extras-keyword</code> as part of its file name. If
there are multiple journal entries for the current date, it prompts
for one among them using minibuffer completion. If there is only one,
it visits it outright. If there is no journal entry, it creates one by
calling <code>denote-journal-extra-new-entry</code> (as described above).
Depending on one&rsquo;s workflow, this can be done via <code>org-capture</code>
(<a href="#h:14d2430e-d60f-4c66-9229-bec2098039d2">Create a journal entry using Org capture</a>).
</p>

<p>
The command <code>denote-journal-extras-link-or-create-entry</code> links to the
journal entry for today or creates it in the background, if missing,
and then links to it from the current file. If there are multiple
journal entries for the same day, it prompts to select one among them
and then links to it. When called with an optional prefix argument
(such as <code>C-u</code> with default key bindings), the command prompts for a
date and then performs the aforementioned. With a double prefix
argument (<code>C-u C-u</code>), it also produces a link whose description
includes just the file&rsquo;s identifier.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:4af1f81e-e93a-43cc-b344-960032a16d42">
<p>
[ Revised as part of version 2.1.0 to conform with how we
  now tend to the needs of users who use Denote for journaling
  purposes (<a href="#h:4a6d92dd-19eb-4fcc-a7b5-05ce04da3a92">Keep a journal or diary</a>). ]
</p>

<p>
Sometimes journaling is done with the intent to hone one&rsquo;s writing
skills.  Perhaps you are learning a new language or wish to communicate
your ideas with greater clarity and precision.  As with everything that
requires a degree of sophistication, you have to work for it&#x2014;write,
write, write!
</p>

<p>
One way to test your progress is to set a timer.  It helps you gauge
your output and its quality.  To use a timer with Emacs, consider the
<code>tmr</code> package.  A new timer can be set with something like this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">;; Set 10 minute timer with the given description
(tmr "10" "Practice writing in my journal")
</pre>
</div>

<p>
To make this timer start as soon as a new journal entry is created
with the command <code>denote-journal-extras-new-entry</code>, add a function to
the <code>denote-journal-extras-hook</code>.  For example:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">;; Add an anonymous function, which is more difficult to modify after
;; the fact:
(add-hook 'denote-journal-extras-hook (lambda ()
                                        (tmr "10" "Practice writing in my journal")))

;; Or write a small function that you can then modify without
;; revaluating the hook:
(defun my-denote-tmr ()
  (tmr "10" "Practice writing in my journal"))

(add-hook 'denote-journal-extras-hook 'my-denote-tmr)

;; Or to make it fully featured, define variables for the duration and
;; the description and set it up so that you only need to modify
;; those:
(defvar my-denote-tmr-duration "10")

(defvar my-denote-tmr-description "Practice writing in my journal")

(defun my-denote-tmr ()
  (tmr my-denote-tmr-duration my-denote-tmr-description))

(add-hook 'denote-journal-extras-hook 'my-denote-tmr)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Once the timer elapses, stop writing and review your performance.
Practice makes perfect!

<p>
Denote has a dedicated minibuffer history for each one of its prompts.
This practically means that using <code>M-p</code> (<code>previous-history-element</code>) and
<code>M-n</code> (<code>next-history-element</code>) will only cycle through the relevant
record of inputs, such as your latest titles in the <code>TITLE</code> prompt, and
keywords in the <code>KEYWORDS</code> prompt.

The built-in <code>savehist</code> library saves minibuffer histories.  Sample

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:113a13e1-35da-46f1-9414-81e9be2facc1">
<p>
The <code>consult-denote</code> package by me (Protesilaos) integrates Denote
with Daniel Mendler&rsquo;s <code>consult</code> package: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/consult-denote">https://github.com/protesilaos/consult-denote</a>.
</p>

<p>
The idea is to preserve the familiar patterns of interaction with the
various Denote commands but add to them an extra layer of
functionality, such as the preview mechanism that Consult provides
(e.g. preview the file you are about to link to).
</p>

<p>
Additionally, <code>consult-denote</code> defines new &ldquo;sources&rdquo; for the
<code>consult-buffer</code> command. This command provides a single point of
entry for buffers, recently opened files, and bookmarks. With
<code>consult-denote</code>, it has a dedicated place for Denote-specific
buffers, silos, and more (all of which are configurable).
</p>

<p>
Unlike the <code>consult-notes</code> package by Colin McLear, <code>consult-denote</code>
uses the same presentation of data in the minibuffer to stay in sync
with Denote and make its feature set entirely optional (<a href="#h:8907f4bc-992a-45bc-a60e-267ed1ce9c2d">Use the <code>consult-notes</code> package</a>).
It also only works with Denote.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:c905b733-e959-4aa4-8f2c-0ed9eba459df">
<p>
The <code>denote-search</code> package by Lucas Quintana provides a search
utility for Denote: <a href="https://github.com/lmq-10/denote-search">https://github.com/lmq-10/denote-search</a>.
</p>

<p>
It allows you to search for a regular expression in the content of
your notes. Its main advantages over other similar tools are the
possibility of filtering the results by file name and doing further
searches in the files matched previously. This allows for advanced
usage (think about finding a note with two or three specific words in
different lines and with a specific keyword). More features are
described in its comprehensive manual. <code>denote-search</code> builds upon
standard Emacs libraries, namely Xref, and so it doesn&rsquo;t have external
dependencies other than Denote itself.

<p>
Peter Prevos has produced the <code>citar-denote</code> package which makes it
possible to write notes on BibTeX entries with the help of the <code>citar</code>
package.  These notes have the citation&rsquo;s unique key associated with
them in the file&rsquo;s front matter.  They also get a configurable keyword
in their file name, making it easy to find them in Dired and/or
retrieve them with the various Denote methods.
</p>

<p>
With <code>citar-denote</code>, the user leverages standard minibuffer completion
mechanisms (e.g. with the help of the <code>vertico</code> and <code>embark</code> packages)
to manage bibliographic notes and access those notes with ease.  The

<p>
If you are using Daniel Mendler&rsquo;s <code>consult</code> (which is a brilliant
package), you will most probably like its <code>consult-notes</code> extension,
developed by Colin McLear.  It uses the familiar mechanisms of Consult
to preview the currently selected entry and to filter searches via a
prefix key.  For example:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(setq consult-notes-file-dir-sources
      `(("Denote Notes"  ?d ,(denote-directory))
        ("Books"  ?b "~/Documents/books/")))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
With the above, <code>M-x consult-notes</code> will list the files in those two
directories.  If you type <code>d</code> and space, it narrows the list to just
the notes, while <code>b</code> does the same for books.
</p>

<p>
The other approach is to enable the <code>consult-notes-denote-mode</code>.  It
takes care to add the <code>denote-directory</code> to the sources that
<code>consult-notes</code> reads from.  Denote notes are then filtered by the <code>d</code>
prefix followed by a space.
</p>

<p>
The minor mode has the extra feature of reformatting the title of
notes shown in the minibuffer.  It isolates the <code>TITLE</code> component of
each note and shows it without hyphens, while presenting keywords in
their own column.  The user option <code>consult-notes-denote-display-id</code>
can be set to <code>nil</code> to hide the identifier.  Depending on how one
searches through their notes, this refashioned presentation may be the
best option (<a href="#h:1a953736-86c2-420b-b566-fb22c97df197">Features of the file-naming scheme for searching or filtering</a>).

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:472db709-27de-4a1f-a171-c3fe0a7a9be8">
<p>
Denote&rsquo;s file-naming scheme is designed to be efficient and to provide
valueable meta information about the file.  The cost, however, is that
it is terse and harder to read, depending on how the user chooses to
filter and process their notes.
</p>

<p>
To this end, <a href="https://github.com/namilus/denote-menu">the <code>denote-menu</code> package by Mohamed Suliman</a> provides the
convenience of a nice tabular interface for all notes.  <code>denote-menu</code>
removes the delimiters that are found in Denote file names and
presents the information in a human-readable format.  Furthermore, the
package provides commands to interact with the list of notes, such as
to filter them and to transition from the tabular list to Dired.  Its
documentation expands on the technicalities.

<p>
The <a href="https://github.com/krisbalintona/denote-zettel-interface"><code>denote-zettel-interface</code> package by Kristoffer Balintona</a> is
designed for those who want to use Denote while adhering to a strict
Zettelkasten methodology of sequence notes (Folgezettel). This method
leverages the optional <code>SIGNATURE</code> file name component of Denote (<a href="#h:4e9c7512-84dc-4dfb-9fa9-e15d51178e5d">The file-naming scheme</a>).
The package provides a point of entry to one&rsquo;s note by visualising
them in a tabulated (grid) interface. Files are sorted by their
Folgezettel index. Users can then use a number of commands to filter
their files, navigate around, and the like.

<p>
Denote is a tool with a narrow scope: create notes and link between
them, based on the aforementioned file-naming scheme. For other common
operations the user is advised to rely on standard Emacs facilities or
specialised third-party packages (<a href="#h:08b14682-e73f-4b11-b2e2-be3b788c8572">Packages that build on Denote</a>). This

The commands that create new files are designed to write to the

any file by its identifier if it is in the <code>denote-directory</code>
(searching the entire file system would be cumbersome).
</p>

However, these are cases where the user needs to create a new note in
an arbitrary directory. The following command can do this. Put the

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:ea173a01-69ef-4574-89a7-6e60ede02f13">
<p>
Emacs&rsquo; standard file manager (or directory editor) can read a regular
expression to mark the matching files.  This is the command
<code>dired-mark-files-regexp</code>, which is bound to <code>% m</code> by default.  For
example, <code>% m _denote</code> will match all files that have the <code>denote</code>
keyword (<a href="#h:1a953736-86c2-420b-b566-fb22c97df197">Features of the file-naming scheme for searching or filtering</a>).
</p>

<p>
Once the files are matched, the user has two options: (i) narrow the
list to the matching items or (ii) exclude the matching items from the
list.
</p>

<p>
For the former, we want to toggle the marks by typing <code>t</code> (calls the
command <code>dired-toggle-marks</code> by default) and then hit the letter <code>k</code>
(for <code>dired-do-kill-lines</code>).  The remaining files are those that match
the regexp that was provided earlier.
</p>

<p>
For the latter approach of filtering out the matching items, simply
involves the use of the <code>k</code> command (<code>dired-do-kill-lines</code>) to omit the
marked files from the list.
</p>

<p>
These sequences can be combined to incrementally narrow the list.  Note
that <code>dired-do-kill-lines</code> does not delete files: it simply hides them
from the current view.
</p>

<p>
Revert to the original listing with <code>g</code> (<code>revert-buffer</code>).
</p>

<p>
For a convenient wrapper, consider this example:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<p>
Emacs&rsquo; Dired is a powerful file manager that builds its functionality
on top of the Unix <code>ls</code> command.  As noted elsewhere in this manual,
the user can update the <code>ls</code> flags that Dired uses to display its
contents (<a href="#h:a7fd5e0a-78f7-434e-aa2e-e150479c16e2">I want to sort by last modified, why won&rsquo;t Denote let me?</a>).
</p>

<p>
What Dired cannot do is parse the output of a result that is produced
by piped commands, such as <code>ls -l | sort -t _ -k2</code>.  This specific
example targets the second underscore-separated field of the file
name, per our conventions (<a href="#h:4e9c7512-84dc-4dfb-9fa9-e15d51178e5d">The file-naming scheme</a>).  Conceretely, it
matches the &ldquo;alpha&rdquo; as the sorting key in something like this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">20220929T200432--testing-file-one__alpha.txt
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Consider then, how Dired will sort those files by their identifier:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">20220929T200432--testing-file-one__alpha.txt
20220929T200532--testing-file-two__beta.txt
20220929T200632--testing-file-three__alpha.txt
20220929T200732--testing-file-four__beta.txt
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Whereas on the command line, we can get the following:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org8266509">
$ ls | sort -t _ -k 2
20220929T200432--testing-file-one__alpha.txt
20220929T200632--testing-file-three__alpha.txt
20220929T200532--testing-file-two__beta.txt
20220929T200732--testing-file-four__beta.txt
</pre>

<p>
This is where <code>dired-virtual-mode</code> shows its utility.  If we tweak our
command-line invocation to include <code>ls -l</code>, this mode can behave like
Dired on the listed files.  (We omit the output of the <code>-l</code> flag from
this tutorial, as it is too verbose.)
</p>

<p>
What we now need is to capture the output of <code>ls -l | sort -t _ -k 2</code>
in an Emacs buffer and then enable <code>dired-virtual-mode</code>.  To do that,
we can rely on either <code>M-x shell</code> or <code>M-x eshell</code> and then manually
copy the relevant contents.
</p>

<p>
For the user&rsquo;s convenience, I share what I have for Eshell to quickly
capture the last command&rsquo;s output in a dedicated buffer:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(defcustom prot-eshell-output-buffer "*Exported Eshell output*"

  (let ((beg (save-excursion
               (goto-char (eshell-beginning-of-input))
               (goto-char (point-at-bol)))))
    (when (derived-mode-p 'eshell-mode)
      (buffer-substring-no-properties beg (eshell-end-of-output)))))

;;;###autoload
(defun prot-eshell-export ()
  "Produce a buffer with output of the last Eshell command.

  (interactive)
  (let ((eshell-output (prot-eshell--command-prompt-output)))
    (with-current-buffer (get-buffer-create prot-eshell-output-buffer)
      (let ((inhibit-read-only t))
        (goto-char (point-max))
        (unless (eq (point-min) (point-max))

        (insert eshell-output)
        (switch-to-buffer-other-window (current-buffer))))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Bind <code>prot-eshell-export</code> to a key in the <code>eshell-mode-map</code> and give
it a try (I use <code>C-c C-e</code>).  In the produced buffer, activate the
<code>dired-virtual-mode</code>.

<p>
<code>embark</code> is a remarkable package that lets you perform relevant,
context-dependent actions using a prefix key (simplifying in the
interest of brevity).
</p>

<p>
For our purposes, Embark can be used to produce a Dired listing
directly from the minibuffer.  Suppose the current note has links to
three other notes.  You might use the <code>denote-find-link</code> command to
pick one via the minibuffer.  But why not turn those three links into
their own Dired listing?  While in the minibuffer, invoke <code>embark-act</code>
which you may have already bound to <code>C-.</code> and then follow it up with
<code>E</code> (for the <code>embark-export</code> command).
</p>

<p>
This pattern can be repeated with any list of candidates, meaning that
you can narrow the list by providing some input before eventually
exporting the results with Embark.
</p>

<p>
Overall, this is very powerful and you might prefer it over doing the
same thing directly in Dired, since you also benefit from all the power
of the minibuffer (<a href="#h:ea173a01-69ef-4574-89a7-6e60ede02f13">Narrow the list of files in Dired</a>).

Emacs provides built-in commands which are wrappers of standard Unix

<p>
Part of the reason Denote does not reinvent existing functionality is to
encourage you to learn more about Emacs.  You do not need a bespoke
&ldquo;jump to my notes&rdquo; directory because such commands do not scale well.
Will you have a &ldquo;jump to my downloads&rdquo; then another for multimedia and
so on?  No.
</p>

<p>
Emacs has a built-in framework for recording persistent markers to
locations.  Visit the <code>denote-directory</code> (or any dir/file for that
matter) and invoke the <code>bookmark-set</code> command (bound to <code>C-x r m</code> by
default).  It lets you create a bookmark.
</p>

<p>
The list of bookmarks can be reviewed with the <code>bookmark-bmenu-list</code>
command (bound to <code>C-x r l</code> by default).  A minibuffer interface is
available with <code>bookmark-jump</code> (<code>C-x r b</code>).
</p>

<p>
If you use the <code>consult</code> package, its default <code>consult-buffer</code> command
has the means to group together buffers, recent files, and bookmarks.
Each of those types can be narrowed to with a prefix key.  The package
<code>consult-dir</code> is an extension to <code>consult</code> which provides useful extras
for working with directories, including bookmarks.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:fad3eb08-ddc7-43e4-ba28-210d89668037">
<p>
Emacs has a built-in library for treating a directory tree as a
&ldquo;project&rdquo;.  This means that the contents of this tree are seen as part
of the same set, so commands like <code>project-switch-to-buffer</code> (<code>C-x p b</code>
by default) will only consider buffers in the current project
(e.g. three notes that are currently being visited).
</p>

<p>
Normally, a &ldquo;project&rdquo; is a directory tree whose root is under version
control.  For our purposes, all you need is to navigate to the
<code>denote-directory</code> (for the shell or via Dired) and use the command-line
to run this (requires the <code>git</code> executable):
</p>

<pre class="example">
git init
</pre>


<p>
From Dired, you can type <code>M-!</code> which invokes <code>dired-smart-shell-command</code>
and then run the git call there.
</p>

<p>
The project can then be registered by invoking any project-related
command inside of it, such as <code>project-find-file</code> (<code>C-x p f</code>).
</p>

<p>
It is a good idea to keep your notes under version control, as that
gives you a history of changes for each file.  We shall not delve into
the technicalities here, though suffice to note that Emacs&rsquo; built-in
version control framework or the exceptionally well-crafted <code>magit</code>
package will get the job done (VC can work with other backends besides
Git).

<p>
Older versions of Denote had a file prompt that resembled that of the
standard <code>find-file</code> command (bound to <code>C-x C-f</code> by default).  This
means that it used a tree-based method of navigating the filesystem by
selecting the specific directory and then the given file.
</p>

<p>
Currently, Denote flattens the file prompt so that every file in the
<code>denote-directory</code> and its subdirectories can be matched from anywhere
using the power of Emacs&rsquo; minibuffer completion (such as with the help
of the <code>orderless</code> package in addition to built-in options).

the helpful Denote-compliant way, users may still need to not prepend
a unique identifier and not sluggify (hyphenate and downcase) the

can be used instead:

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:2d5ee9bf-e8f2-426c-8bf7-bf78bc88d1ee">
<p>
The <code>dired-preview</code> package (by me/Protesilaos) automatically displays
a preview of the file at point in Dired.  This can be helpful in
tandem with Denote when we want to rename multiple files by taking a
quick look at their contents.
</p>

<p>
The command <code>denote-dired-rename-marked-files-with-keywords</code>
will generate Denote-style file names based on the keywords it prompts
for. Identifiers are derived from each file&rsquo;s modification date
(<a href="#h:1b6b2c78-42f0-45b8-9ef0-6de21a8b2cde">Rename multiple files at once</a>). There is no need for any custom code
in this scenario.
</p>

<p>
As noted in the section about Image Dired, the user may sometimes not
need a fully fledged Denote-style file name but only append Denote-like
keywords to each file name (e.g. <code>Original Name__denote_test.jpg</code>
instead of <code>20230710T195843--original-name__denote_test.jpg</code>).
</p>

<p>
<a href="#h:e666ced6-da75-4bdb-9be3-82c2f4455ee9">Rename files with Denote in the Image Dired thumbnails buffer</a>
</p>

<p>
In such a workflow, it is unlikely to be dealing with ordinary text
files where front matter can be helpful.  A custom command does not
need to behave like what Denote provides out-of-the-box, but can
instead append keywords to file names without conducting any further
actions.  We thus have:

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:4a8c4546-26b3-4195-8b2c-b08a519986a4">
<p>
When exporting Denote notes to, for example, an HTML or PDF file,
there is a high probability that the same file name is used with a new
extension.  This is problematic because it creates files with
duplicate identifiers.  The <code>20230515T085612--example__keyword.org</code>
produces a <code>20230515T085612--example__keyword.pdf</code>.  Any link to the
<code>20230515T085612</code> will thus break: it does not honor Denote&rsquo;s
expectation of finding unique identifiers.  This is not the fault of
Denote: exporting is done by the user without Denote&rsquo;s involvement.
</p>

<p>
Org Mode and Markdown use different approaches to exporting files.  No
recommended method is available for plain text files as there is no
standardised export functionality for this format (the user can always
create a new note using the file type they want on a case-by-case
basis: <a href="#h:887bdced-9686-4e80-906f-789e407f2e8f">Convenience commands for note creation</a>).

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-h:67669d9d-17c3-45bd-8227-da57d8bc3b73">
<p>
Org Mode has a built-in configurable export engine.  You can prevent
duplicate identifiers when exporting manually for each exported file
or by advising the Org export function.
</p>

<p>
Denote also provides commands to convert <code>denote:</code> links to their
<code>file:</code> equivalent, in case this is a required pre-processing step for
export purposes (<a href="#h:ed220cac-7dcb-4bb7-9243-1bb85e452e5f">Convert <code>denote:</code> links to <code>file:</code> links</a>).

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-h:bf791e28-73e5-4ed8-88bc-e4e9b3ebaedb">
<p>
Insert <code>#+export_file_name: FILENAME</code> in the front matter before
exporting to force a filename called whatever the value of <code>FILENAME</code>
is.  The <code>FILENAME</code> does not specify the file type extension, such as
<code>.pdf</code>.  This is up to the export engine.  For example, a Denote note
with a complete file name of <code>20230515T085612--example__keyword.org</code>
and a front matter entry of <code>#+export_file_name: hello</code> will be
exported as <code>hello.pdf</code>.
</p>

<p>
The advantage of this manual method is that it gives the user full
control over the resulting file name.  The disadvantage is that it
depends on the user&rsquo;s behaviour.  Forgetting to add a new name can
lead to duplicate identifiers, as already noted in the introduction to
this section (<a href="#h:4a8c4546-26b3-4195-8b2c-b08a519986a4">Export Denote notes</a>).

It is possible to automatically place all exports in another folder by
making Org&rsquo;s function <code>org-export-output-file-name</code> create the target

advising Elisp code must be handled with care, as it might break the
original function in subtle ways.

Using a different directory will require some additional configuration

Exporting from Markdown requires an external processor (e.g.,
Markdown.pl, Pandoc, or MultiMarkdown).  The <code>markdown-command</code>
variable defines the command line used in export, for example:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(setq markdown-command "multimarkdown")

The export process thus occurs outside of Emacs.  Users need to read
the documentation of their preferred processor to prevent the creation
of duplicate Denote identifiers.

<p>
Perhaps as part of work, we meet with certain people on a regular
basis. During the meeting we may discuss a variety of topics. How best
to approach with the help of Denote?
</p>

<p>
One option is to write a new file for each meeting, giving it the
appropriate keywords each time (<a href="#h:17896c8c-d97a-4faa-abf6-31df99746ca6">Points of entry</a>). This is what Denote
does by default and does not need any further tweaks. If we need to
review those notes, we can use the command <code>denote-sort-dired</code>
(<a href="#h:9fe01e63-f34f-4479-8713-f162a5ca865e">Sort files by component</a>), or one of the Org dynamic blocks we provide
(<a href="#h:8b542c50-dcc9-4bca-8037-a36599b22779">Use Org dynamic blocks</a>), among other options.
</p>

<p>
Another approach is to write one file per person with the regular
<code>denote</code> command (or related), give it the name of the person as a
title and, optionally, use some relevant keywords. Inside each file,
write a top-level heading with the date of the meeting, and then
produce the meeting notes below as paragraphs and subheadings. This
can all be done without any changes to Denote, though we can
streamline it by incorporating the following code in our setup.
Configure <code>my-denote-colleagues</code> and then use the command
<code>my-denote-colleagues-new-meeting</code> to see how it works.

Denote is immediately useful for beginners and power users alike. This
manual covers everything in detail, though do not let the numerous
possibilities distract you from the fact that a basic configuration is
enough to be highly productive (<a href="#h:998ae528-9276-47ec-b642-3d7355a38f27">Get started with this sample configuration</a>).

If you are new to Denote, this a good place to start. Then work your
way through the manual and expand your configuration accordingly. Only
include commands/variables that are useful to you. We provide another
code sample if you need some ideas (<a href="#h:58c4746b-b0d8-4896-9d88-a99b1d487231">More comprehensive sample configuration</a>).

Each element is of the form <code>(SYMBOL PROPERTY-LIST)</code>.  <code>SYMBOL</code> is
one of those specified in <code>denote-file-type</code> or an arbitrary symbol
that defines a new file type.
</p>

<p>
<code>PROPERTY-LIST</code> is a plist that consists of the following elements:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><code>:extension</code> is a string with the file extension including the
period.</li>

<li><code>:date-function</code> is a function that can format a date.  See the
functions <code>denote--date-iso-8601</code>, <code>denote--date-rfc3339</code>, and
<code>denote--date-org-timestamp</code>.</li>

<li><code>:front-matter</code> is either a string passed to <code>format</code> or a
variable holding such a string.  The <code>format</code> function accepts
four arguments, which come from <code>denote</code> in this order: <code>TITLE</code>,
<code>DATE</code>, <code>KEYWORDS</code>, <code>IDENTIFIER</code>.  Read the doc string of
<code>format</code> on how to reorder arguments.</li>

<li><code>:title-key-regexp</code> is a regular expression that is used to
retrieve the title line in a file.  The first line matching this
regexp is considered the title line.</li>

<li><code>:title-value-function</code> is the function used to format the raw
title string for inclusion in the front matter (e.g. to surround
it with quotes).  Use the <code>identity</code> function if no further
processing is required.</li>

<li><code>:title-value-reverse-function</code> is the function used to retrieve
the raw title string from the front matter.  It performs the
reverse of <code>:title-value-function</code>.</li>

<li><code>:keywords-key-regexp</code> is a regular expression used to retrieve
the keywords&rsquo; line in the file.  The first line matching this
regexp is considered the keywords&rsquo; line.</li>

<li><code>:keywords-value-function</code> is the function used to format the
keywords&rsquo; list of strings as a single string, with appropriate
delimiters, for inclusion in the front matter.</li>

<li><code>:keywords-value-reverse-function</code> is the function used to retrieve
the keywords&rsquo; value from the front matter.  It performs the reverse
of the <code>:keywords-value-function</code>.</li>

<li><code>:link</code> is a string, or variable holding a string, that
specifies the format of a link.  See the variables
<code>denote-org-link-format</code>, <code>denote-md-link-format</code>.</li>

<li><code>:link-in-context-regexp</code> is a regular expression that is used
to match the aforementioned link format.  See the variables
<code>denote-org-link-in-context-regexp</code>, <code>denote-md-link-in-context-regexp</code>.</li>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-h:9c4467d5-6480-4681-80fb-cd9717bf8b3b">
<p>
Sometimes we get reports on bugs that may not be actually caused by
some error in the Denote code base.  To help gain insight into what
the problem is, we need to be able to reproduce the issue in a minimum
viable system.  Below is one way to achieve this.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Find where your <code>denote.el</code> file is stored on your filesystem.</li>

<li>Assuming you have already installed the package, one way to do this
is to invoke <code>M-x find-library</code> and search for <code>denote</code>.  It will
take you to the source file.  There do <code>M-x eval-expression</code>, which
will bring up a minibuffer prompt.  At the prompt evaluate:</li>
</ol>

<pre class="example" id="orgdc18e15">
(kill-new (expand-file-name (buffer-file-name)))
</pre>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The above will save the full file system path to your kill ring.</li>

<li>In a terminal emulator or an <code>M-x shell</code> buffer execute:</li>
</ol>

<pre class="example" id="org0f41ce5">
emacs -Q
</pre>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>This will open a new instance of Emacs in a pristine environment.
Only the default settings are loaded.</li>

<li>In the <code>*scratch*</code> buffer of <code>emacs -Q</code>, add your configurations
like the following and try to reproduce the issue:</li>
</ol>

<pre class="example" id="org9b483d4">
(require 'denote "/full/path/to/what/you/got/denote.el")

;; Your configurations here
</pre>

<p>
Then try to see if your problem still occurs.  If it does, then the
fault is with Denote.  Otherwise there is something external to it
that we need to account for.  Whatever the case, this exercise helps
us get a better sense of the specifics.

<p>
These are various ideas to extend Denote. Whether they should be in
the core package or a separate extension is something we can discuss.
I, Protesilaos, am happy to help anyone who wants to do any of this.
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>denote-embark.el</dt><dd>Provide integration with the <code>embark</code> package.
This can be for doing something with the identifier/link at point.
For example, it could provide an action to produce backlinks for the
identifier/file we are linking to, not just the current one.</dd>

<dt>denote-transient.el</dt><dd>The <code>transient</code> package is built into Emacs
29 (Denote supports Emacs 28 though). We can use it to define an
alternative to what we have for the menu bar. Perhaps this interface
can used to toggle various options, such as to call <code>denote</code> with a
different set of prompts.</dd>

<dt>A <code>denote-directories</code> user option</dt><dd>This can be either an
extension of the <code>denote-directory</code> (accept a list of file paths
value) or a new variable. The idea is to let the user define
separate Denote directories which do know about the presence of each
other (unlike silos). This way, a user can have an entry in
<code>~/Documents/notes/</code> link to something <code>~/Git/projects/</code> and
everything work as if the <code>denote-directory</code> is set to the <code>~/</code>
(with the status quo as of 2024-02-18 08:27 +0200).</dd>

<dt>Encode the day in the identifier</dt><dd>The idea is to use some coded
reference for Monday, Tuesday, etc. instead of having the generic
<code>T</code> in the identifier. For example, Monday is <code>A</code> so the identifier
for it is something like <code>20240219A101522</code> instead of what we now
have as <code>20240219T101522</code>. The old method should still be supported.
Apart from changing a few regular expressions, this does not seem
too complex to me. We would need a user option to opt in to such a
feature. Then tweak the relevant parts. The tricky issue is to
define a mapping of day names to letters/symbols that works for
everyone. Do all countries have a seven-day week, for example? We
need something universally applicable here.</dd>

<p>
What follows is a list of Emacs packages for note-taking.  I
(Protesilaos) have not used any of them, as I was manually applying my
file-naming scheme beforehand and by the time those packages were
available I was already hacking on the predecessor of Denote as a means
of learning Emacs Lisp (a package which I called &ldquo;Unassuming Sidenotes
of Little Significance&rdquo;, aka &ldquo;USLS&rdquo; which is pronounced as &ldquo;U-S-L-S&rdquo; or
&ldquo;useless&rdquo;).  As such, I cannot comment at length on the differences
between Denote and each of those packages, beside what I gather from
their documentation.
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt><a href="https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam">org-roam</a></dt><dd>The de facto standard in the Emacs milieu&#x2014;and rightly
so!  It has a massive community, is featureful, and should be an
excellent companion to anyone who is invested in the Org ecosystem
and/or knows what &ldquo;Roam&rdquo; is (I don&rsquo;t).  It has been explained to me
that Org Roam uses a database to store a cache about your notes.  It
otherwise uses standard Org files.  The cache helps refer to the same
node through aliases which can provide lots of options.  Personally, I
follow a single-topic-per-note approach, so anything beyond that is
overkill.  If the database is only for a cache, then maybe that has no
downside, though I am careful with any kind of specialised program as
it creates a dependency.  If you ask me about database software in
particular, I have no idea how to use one, let alone debug it or
retrieve data from it if something goes awry (I could learn, but that
is beside the point).</dd>

<dt><a href="https://github.com/localauthor/zk">zk (or zk.el)</a></dt><dd>Reading its documentation makes me think that this is
Denote&rsquo;s sibling&#x2014;the two projects have a lot of things in common,
including the preference to rely on plain files and standard tools.
The core difference is that Denote has a strict file-naming scheme.
Other differences in available features are, in principle, matters of
style or circumstance: both packages can have them.  As its initials
imply, ZK enables a zettelkasten-like workflow.  It does not enforce
it though, letting the user adapt the method to their needs and
requirements.</dd>

<dt><a href="https://github.com/ymherklotz/emacs-zettelkasten">zettelkasten</a></dt><dd>This is another one of Denote&rsquo;s relatives, at least
insofar as the goal of simplicity is concerned.  The major difference
is that according to its documentation &ldquo;the name of the file that is
created is just a unique ID&rdquo;.  This is not consistent with our
file-naming scheme which is all about making sense of your files by
their name alone and being able to visually parse a listing of them
without any kind of specialised tool (e.g. <code>ls -l</code> or <code>ls -C</code> on the
command-line from inside the <code>denote-directory</code> give you a
human-readable set of files names, while <code>find * -maxdepth 0 -type f</code>
is another approach).</dd>

<dt><a href="https://github.com/EFLS/zetteldeft">zetteldeft</a></dt><dd>This is a zettelkasten note-taking system built on top
of the <code>deft</code> package.  Deft provides a search interface to a
directory, in this case the one holding the user&rsquo;s <code>zetteldeft</code> notes.
Denote has no such dependency and is not opinionated about how the
user prefers to search/access their notes: use Dired, Grep, the
<code>consult</code> package, or whatever else you already have set up for all
things Emacs, not just your notes.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Searching through <code>M-x list-packages</code> for &ldquo;zettel&rdquo; brings up more
matches.  <code>zetteldesk</code> is an extension to Org Roam and, as such, I
cannot possibly know what Org Roam truly misses and what the added-value
of this package is.  <code>neuron-mode</code> builds on top of an external program
called <code>neuron</code>, which I have never used.
</p>

<p>
Searching for &ldquo;note&rdquo; gives us a few more results.  <code>notes-mode</code> has
precious little documentation and I cannot tell what it actually does
(as I said in my presentation for LibrePlanet 2022, inadequate docs are
a bug).  <code>side-notes</code> differs from what we try to do with Denote, as it
basically gives you the means to record your thoughts about some other
project you are working on and keep them on the side: so it and Denote
should not be mutually exclusive.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:b875450a-ae22-4899-ac23-c10fa9c279bb">
<p>
I wrote Denote because I was using a variant of Denote&rsquo;s file-naming
scheme before I was even an Emacs user (I switched to Emacs from
Tmux+Vim+CLI in the summer of 2019).  I was originally inspired by
Jekyll, the static site generator, which I started using for my website
in 2016 (was on WordPress before).  Jekyll&rsquo;s files follow the
<code>YYYY-MM-DD-TITLE.md</code> pattern.  I liked its efficiency relative to the
unstructured mess I had before.  Eventually, I started using that scheme
outside the confines of my website&rsquo;s source code.  Over time I refined
it and here we are.
</p>

<p>
Note-taking is something I take very seriously, as I am a prolific
writer (just check my website, which only reveals the tip of the
iceberg).  As such, I need a program that does exactly what I want and
which I know how to extend.  I originally tried to use Org capture
templates to create new files with a Denote-style file-naming scheme but
never managed to achieve it.  Maybe because <code>org-capture</code> has some
hard-coded assumptions or I simply am not competent enough to hack on
core Org facilities.  Whatever the case, an alternative was in order.
</p>

<p>
The existence of PACKAGE is never a good reason for me not to conduct my
own experiments for recreational, educational, or practical purposes.
When the question arises of &ldquo;why not contribute to PACKAGE instead?&rdquo; the
answer is that without me experimenting in the first place, I would lack
the skills for such a task.  Furthermore, contributing to another
package does not guarantee I get what I want in terms of workflow.
</p>

<p>
Whether you should use Denote or not is another matter altogether:
choose whatever you want.

<div id="outline-container-h:b9831849-5c71-484e-b444-bac19cc13151" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="h:b9831849-5c71-484e-b444-bac19cc13151"><span class="section-number-3">25.2.</span> Why not rely exclusively on Org?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:b9831849-5c71-484e-b444-bac19cc13151">
<p>
I think Org is one of Emacs&rsquo; killer apps.  I also believe it is not the
right tool for every job.  When I write notes, I want to focus on
writing.  Nothing more.  I thus have no need for stuff like org-babel,
scheduling to-do items, clocking time, and so on.  The more &ldquo;mental
dependencies&rdquo; you add to your workflow, the heavier the burden you carry
and the less focused you are on the task at hand: there is always that
temptation to tweak the markup, tinker with some syntactic construct,
obsess about what ought to be irrelevant to writing as such.
</p>

<p>
In technical terms, I also am not fond of Org&rsquo;s code base (I understand
why it is the way it is&#x2014;just commenting on the fact).  Ever tried to
read it?  You will routinely find functions that are tens-to-hundreds of
lines long and have all sorts of special casing.  As I am not a
programmer and only learnt to write Elisp through trial and error, I
have no confidence in my ability to make Org do what I want at that
level, hence <code>denote</code> instead of <code>org-denote</code> or something.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the master programmer is one who can deal with complexity and
keep adding to it.  I am of the opposite view, as language&#x2014;code
included&#x2014;is at its communicative best when it is clear and accessible.
</p>

<p>
Make no mistake: I use Org for the agenda and also to write technical
documentation that needs to be exported to various formats, including
this very manual.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:da1e2469-8f04-450b-a379-a854efa80a36">
<p>
My notes form part of my longer-term storage.  I do not want to have to
rely on a special program to be able to read them or filter them.  Unix
is universal, at least as far as I am concerned.
</p>

<p>
Denote streamlines some tasks and makes things easier in general, which
is consistent with how Emacs provides a layer of interactivity on top of
Unix.  Still, Denote&rsquo;s utilities can, in principle, be implemented as
POSIX shell scripts (minus the Emacs-specific parts like fontification
in Dired or the buttonization of links).
</p>

<p>
Portability matters.  For example, in the future I might own a
smartphone, so I prefer not to require Emacs, Org, or some other
executable to access my files on the go.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, I might want to share those files with someone.  If I make
Emacs a requirement, I am limiting my circle to a handful of relatively
advanced users.
</p>

<p>
Please don&rsquo;t misinterpret this: I am using Emacs full-time for my
computing and maintain a growing list of packages for it.  This is just
me thinking long-term.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:7d2e7b8a-d484-4c1d-8688-17f70f242ad7">
<p>
I have read that Org favours the latter method.  If true, I strongly
disagree with it because of the implicit dependency it introduces and
the way it favours machine-friendliness over human-readability in terms
of accessing information.  Notes are long-term storage.  I might want to
access them on (i) some device with limited features, (ii) print on
paper, (iii) share with another person who is not a tech wizard.
</p>

<p>
There are good arguments for few large files, but all either prioritize
machine-friendliness or presuppose the use of sophisticated tools like
Emacs+Org.
</p>

<p>
Good luck using <code>less</code> on a generic TTY to read a file with a zillion
words, headings, sub-headings, sub-sub-headings, property drawers, and
other constructs!  You will not get the otherwise wonderful folding of
headings the way you do in Emacs&#x2014;do not take such features for
granted.
</p>

<p>
My point is that notes should be atomic to help the user&#x2014;and
potentially the user&rsquo;s family, friends, acquaintances&#x2014;make sense of
them in a wide range of scenaria.  The more program-agnostic your file
is, the better for you and/or everyone else you might share your
writings with.
</p>

<p>
Human-readability means that we optimize for what matters to us.  If (a)
you are the only one who will ever read your notes, (b) always have
access to good software like Emacs+Org, (c) do not care about printing
on paper, then Denote&rsquo;s model is not for you.  Maybe you need to tweak
some <code>org-capture</code> template to append a new entry to one mega file (I do
that for my Org agenda, by the way, as I explained before about using
the right tool for the job).

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:863f812a-aac7-42ea-83b3-fbbdb58e08d7">
<p>
Denote does not do anything fancy and has no special requirements: it
uses standard tools to accomplish ordinary tasks.  If Emacs can cope
with lots of files, then that is all you need to know: Denote will work.
</p>

<p>
To put this to the test, Peter Prevos is running simulations with R that
generate large volumes of notes.  You can read the technicalities here:
<a href="https://lucidmanager.org/productivity/testing-denote-package/">https://lucidmanager.org/productivity/testing-denote-package/</a>.

Using this code I generated ten thousands notes and used this to test
the Denote package to see it if works at a large scale. This tests shows
that Prot&rsquo;s approach is perfectly capable of working with thousands of

necessary, without compromising on the project&rsquo;s principles.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:63c2f8d4-79ed-4c55-b3ef-e048a05802c0">
<p>
Yes, many files will slow down the agenda due to how that works.  Org
collects all files specified in the <code>org-agenda-files</code>, searches through
their contents for timestamped entries, and then loops through all days
to determine where each entry belongs.  The more days and more files,
the longer it takes to build the agenda.  Doing this with potentially
hundreds of files will have a noticeable impact on performance.
</p>

<p>
This is not a deficiency of Denote.  It happens with generic Org files.
The way the agenda is built is heavily favoring the use of a single file
that holds all your timestamped entries (or at least a few such files).
Tens or hundreds of files are inefficient for this job.  Plus doing so
has the side-effect of making Emacs open all those files, which you
probably do not need.
</p>

<p>
If you want my opinion though, be more forceful with the separation of
concerns.  Decouple your knowledge base from your ephemeral to-do list:
Denote (and others) can be used for the former, while you let standard
Org work splendidly for the latter&#x2014;that is what I do, anyway.
</p>

<p>
Org has a powerful linking facility, whether you use <code>org-store-link</code> or
do it via an <code>org-capture</code> template.  If you want a certain note to be
associated with a task, just store the task in a single <code>tasks.org</code> (or
however you name it) and link to the relevant context.
</p>

<p>
Do not mix your knowledge base with your to-do items.  If you need help
figuring out the specifics of this workflow, you are welcome to ask for
help in our relevant channels (<a href="#h:1ebe4865-c001-4747-a6f2-0fe45aad71cd">Contributing</a>).

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:a7fd5e0a-78f7-434e-aa2e-e150479c16e2">
<p>
Denote does not control how Dired sorts files. I encourage you to read
the manpage of the <code>ls</code> executable. It will help you in general, while
it applies to Emacs as well via Dired. The gist is that you can update
the <code>ls</code> flags that Dired uses on-the-fly: type <code>C-u M-x
dired-sort-toggle-or-edit</code> (<code>C-u s</code> by default) and append
<code>--sort=time</code> at the prompt. To reverse the order, add the <code>-r</code> flag.
The user option <code>dired-listing-switches</code> sets your default preference.
</p>

<p>
For an on-demand sorted and filtered Dired listing of Denote files,
use the command <code>denote-sort-dired</code> (<a href="#h:9fe01e63-f34f-4479-8713-f162a5ca865e">Sort files by component</a>).

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:764b5e87-cd22-4937-b5fc-af3892d6b3d8">
<p>
Denote does not insert any meta data or heading pertaining to edits in
the file.  I am of the view that these either do not scale well or are
not descriptive enough.  Suppose you use a &ldquo;lastmod&rdquo; heading with a
timestamp: which lines where edited and what did the change amount to?
</p>

<p>
This is where an external program can be helpful.  Use a Version Control
System, such as Git, to keep track of all your notes.  Every time you
add a new file, record the addition.  Same for post-creation edits.
Your VCS will let you review the history of those changes.  For
instance, Emacs&rsquo; built-in version control framework has a command that
produces a log of changes for the current file: <code>M-x vc-print-log</code>,
bound to <code>C-x v l</code> by default.  From there one can access the
corresponding diff output (use <code>M-x describe-mode</code> (<code>C-h m</code>) in an
unfamiliar buffer to learn more about it).  With Git in particular,
Emacs users have the option of the all-round excellent <code>magit</code> package.
</p>

<p>
In short: let Denote (or equivalent) create notes and link between them,
the file manager organise and provide access to files, search programs
deal with searching and narrowing, and version control software handle
the tracking of changes.

<h3 id="h:4f354db1-aa78-47fd-ac60-c3d1e0f0b0a4"><span class="section-number-3">25.9.</span> Why are some Org links opening outside Emacs?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:4f354db1-aa78-47fd-ac60-c3d1e0f0b0a4">
<p>
Org has its own mechanism to determine how best to open a link. This
affects the <code>file:</code> link type, but also the <code>denote:</code> one (which is
designed to be as close to <code>file:</code> as possible).
</p>

<p>
When following a link, Org usually displays the data in an Emacs
buffer, though it might launch an external application instead. The
idea is to use a specialised program when that is relevant, such as to
display a video. Though there can be scenaria the user does not like,
such as when Org decides to load <code>.md</code> or <code>.html</code> files with an
external app. To compound the problem, users can name any file type
using the Denote file-naming scheme, including images, PDFs, videos,
and more (<a href="#h:532e8e2a-9b7d-41c0-8f4b-3c5cbb7d4dca">Renaming files</a>).
</p>

<p>
To instruct Org to stay in Emacs for such cases, the user needs to
modify the variable <code>org-file-apps</code>, which is not specific to Denote.
As one use-case, <code>org-file-apps</code> associates a regular expression to
match file names with a method on how to display them (do <code>M-x
describe-variable</code> and then search for <code>org-file-apps</code> to read its
documentation). Thus, the user can use something like the following
in their Org or Denote configuration:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">;; Tell Org to use Emacs when opening files that end in .md
(add-to-list 'org-file-apps '("\\.md\\'" . emacs))

;; Do the same for .html
(add-to-list 'org-file-apps '("\\.html\\'" . emacs))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Each of these adds a new entry to the existing value of that user
option. Replace <code>md</code> or <code>html</code> with the desired file type extension.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-h:893eec49-d7be-4603-bcff-fcc247244011" class="outline-3">

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:893eec49-d7be-4603-bcff-fcc247244011">
<p>
Denote leverages the built-in <code>xref</code> library to search for the
identifier of the current file and return any links to it.  For users
of Emacs version 28 or higher, there exists a user option to specify
the program that performs this search: <code>xref-search-program</code>.  The
default is <code>grep</code>, which can be slow, though one may opt for <code>ugrep</code>,
<code>ripgrep</code>, or even specify something else (read the doc string of that
user option for the details).
</p>

<p>
Try either for these for better results:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(setq xref-search-program 'ripgrep)

;; OR

(setq xref-search-program 'ugrep)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
To use whatever executable is available on your system, use something
like this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">;; Prefer ripgrep, then ugrep, and fall back to regular grep.
(setq xref-search-program
      (cond
       ((or (executable-find "ripgrep")
            (executable-find "rg"))
        'ripgrep)
       ((executable-find "ugrep")
        'ugrep)
       (t
        'grep)))
</pre>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:42f6b07e-5956-469a-8294-17f9cf62eb2b">
<p>
Denote uses <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/emacs.html#Xref">Emacs&rsquo; Xref</a> to find backlinks.  Xref requires <code>xargs</code> and
one of <code>grep</code> or <code>ripgrep</code>, depending on your configuration.
</p>

<p>
This is usually not an issue on *nix systems, but the necessary
executables are not available on Windows Emacs distributions.  Please
ensure that you have both <code>xargs</code> and either <code>grep</code> or <code>ripgrep</code>
available within your <code>PATH</code> environment variable.
</p>

<p>
If you have <code>git</code> on Windows installed, then you may use the following
code (adjust the git&rsquo;s installation path if necessary):
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">  (setenv "PATH" (concat (getenv "PATH") ";" "C:\\Program Files\\Git\\usr\\bin"))

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:0f737b7d-40e6-46a7-b1db-117c0ffcbfef">
<p>
Doom Emacs provides a set of bespoke templates for Org. One of those
prefills any new Org file with a <code>#+title</code> field. So when Denote
creates a new Org file and inserts front matter to it, it inevitably
adds an extra title to the existing one.
</p>

<p>
This is not a Denote problem. We can only expect a new file to be
empty by default. Check how to disable the relevant module in your
Doom Emacs configuration file.

                GNU Free Documentation License
                 Version 1.3, 3 November 2008


 Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

0. PREAMBLE

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.


1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The "Document", below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
processors for output purposes only.

The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies of
the Document to the public.

A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)  To "Preserve the Title"
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.

The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.

2. VERBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no
other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.


3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
Document.


4. MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
   unless they release you from this requirement.
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
   Modified Version, as the publisher.
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add
   to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
   there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
   Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
   the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
   and/or dedications given therein.
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
   may not be included in the Modified Version.
N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements"
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.


5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
"History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements",
and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
Entitled "Endorsements".


6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
documents released under this License, and replace the individual
copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules
of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all
other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
document.


7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.


8. TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.


9. TERMINATION

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.


10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the
GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
https://www.gnu.org/licenses/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document.

11. RELICENSING

"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the site
means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.

"CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
published by that same organization.

"Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in
part, as part of another Document.

An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
License, and if all works that were first published under this License
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or
in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and
(2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

    Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
    under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
    or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
    with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
    A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
    Free Documentation License".

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
