This version refines an already stable base. Users do not need to make
any changes to their setup, unless they wish to try the new features.

<p>
With the out-of-the-box settings, Pulsar temporarily highlights the
current line after any of the <code>pulsar-pulse-functions</code> is invoked and
<code>pulsar-mode</code> (or <code>pulsar-global-mode</code>) is enabled.
</p>

<p>
The new user option <code>pulsar-pulse-region-functions</code> makes Pulsar
temporarily highlight the affected region as well. For example, when
pasting some text into the buffer, it will highlight the portion of
text that was added.
</p>

<p>
The default value of <code>pulsar-pulse-region-functions</code> is nil, meaning
that no region pulsing is in effect (what we had before). Otherwise,
it is a list of functions. A typical use-case is the following:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(setq pulsar-pulse-region-functions pulsar-pulse-region-common-functions)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This covers common commands, such as for copying and pasting a region
of text (restart <code>pulsar-mode</code> or <code>pulsar-global-mode</code> if needed).

<p>
The region pulsing is inspired by Daniel Mendler's <code>goggles</code> package,
which itself is a take on a common theme covered by many other such
packages.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-h:f0a6b22a-0534-4633-97fc-1cb072d93d59" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="h:f0a6b22a-0534-4633-97fc-1cb072d93d59">Style region highlights differently</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:f0a6b22a-0534-4633-97fc-1cb072d93d59">
<p>
The following user options control the face of the <code>pulsar-pulse-region-functions</code>.
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt><code>pulsar-region-face</code></dt><dd>Face to pulse a region that has not changed.</dd>
<dt><code>pulsar-region-change-face</code></dt><dd>Face to pulse a region that has changed (added or removed).</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Pulsar defines several faces to get a nice style. Here is an example:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(setq pulsar-region-face 'pulsar-green) ; unchanged regions are green
(setq pulsar-region-change-face 'pulsar-red) ; changed regions are red

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-h:90e443b2-448e-4938-8aa2-783ad84c87fc">
<p>
An alternative to how Pulsar works out-of-the-box by reacting to the
<code>pulsar-pulse-functions</code> is to check for changes to the window layout.
Users who wish to have this behaviour can set the new user option
<code>pulsar-pulse-on-window-change</code> to a non-nil value.
</p>

<p>
As there may be overlap between the <code>pulsar-pulse-functions</code> and the
<code>pulsar-pulse-on-window-change</code>, users are advised to pick only one.
This is not a hard rule though: Pulsar will blithely highlight
everything if configured accordingly.
</p>

contribution. It is part of the aforementioned pull request 25.

<p>
Pulsar will produce a highlight on the current line after one of the
functions in <code>pulsar-pulse-functions</code> is used. This now works for
aliases of those functions as well, even if they are not explicitly
referenced in <code>pulsar-pulse-functions</code>. Whereas before, only the
explicitly named functions would produce the pulse effect.

The command <code>pulsar-pulse-region</code> pulses the active region. Thanks to
Bahman Movaqar for the contribution. This was done on the
now-deprecated mailing list:
<a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/pulsar/169317951630.22395.14797122445974295748-0@git.sr.ht">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/pulsar/169317951630.22395.14797122445974295748-0@git.sr.ht</a>
</p>

<p>
The change is below the ~15 line limit and thus Bahman is not require
to assign copyright to the Free Software Foundation.
</p>

<p>
I still want to make this work with rectangular regions, which are not
contiguous (in terms of character positions reading from left to
right), but it is tricky. Maybe I will do it for the next version.
</p>

<p>
Remember that the command <code>pulsar-highlight-dwim</code> will apply a
temporary highlight to the active region or the current line. The
highlight is removed as soon as another key is pressed.

<li>The <code>next-buffer</code> and <code>previous-buffer</code> commands are added to the
default value of the user option <code>pulsar-pulse-functions</code>.  They
will now trigger a pulse effect after they are called (if
<code>pulsar-mode</code> is enabled in the current buffer or
<code>pulsar-global-mode</code> is in use).</li>

<li>The command <code>pulsar-recenter-middle</code> is now an alias for
<code>pulsar-recenter-center</code>, instead of being the original name.  Users
do not need to change anything on their end: this is just an
internal arrangement to use a name that corresponds to the one of
the underlying "recenter" mechanism.</li>

<li><p>
The Lisp macro that was used to derive the Pulsar "recenter"
commands has been removed.  The commands are <code>pulsar-recenter-top</code>
and <code>pulsar-recenter-center</code>.  I originally thought the macro would
be useful in more places, but I ended up relying on it only twice.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to Ryan Kaskel for pointing out an intermediate typo/error I
made while redefining the macro and before I decided to remove it
altogether.  This was done as a comment on the GitHub mirror:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/pulsar/commit/c5086de779a0226d72eca4d5cba8c7689bc278b2#r123397272">https://github.com/protesilaos/pulsar/commit/c5086de779a0226d72eca4d5cba8c7689bc278b2#r123397272</a>.
</p></li>

<li>The Lisp macro <code>pulsar-pulse-with-face</code> is renamed to
<code>pulsar-define-pulse-with-face</code>.  Its definition is updated to
simplify how a Pulsar function is defined with a given face.
Examples of such functions are <code>pulsar-pulse-line-red</code>,
<code>pulsar-pulse-line-blue</code>.</li>

<li>Pulsar now retrieves the absolute beginning of the minibuffer
prompt.  This means that a pulse in the minibuffer will cover the
text of the prompt, as opposed to only affecting the input area.  As
such, the pulse is visible even if the minibuffer is empty
(e.g. what happens with the default completion setup when calling
<code>M-x</code>).</li>

<li><p>
The manual provides instructions on how to set up Pulsar to produce
a pulse when the minibuffer is activated.  It cannot be done with
the <code>pulsar-pulse-functions</code>, though the setup is not too involved.
In short:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">  (add-hook 'minibuffer-setup-hook #'pulsar-pulse-line)

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Added convenience functions/commands to pulse a line using one of the
provided faces.  These can be used interactively or via Lisp (e.g. be
assigned to a hook).  They are:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>pulsar-pulse-line-red</code></li>
<li><code>pulsar-pulse-line-green</code></li>
<li><code>pulsar-pulse-line-yellow</code></li>
<li><code>pulsar-pulse-line-blue</code></li>
<li><code>pulsar-pulse-line-magenta</code></li>
<li><code>pulsar-pulse-line-cyan</code></li>
</ul></li>

<li>Deprecated <code>pulsar-pulse-on-window-change</code> due to complications it
created in some edge cases.  Part of this effort was to fix a bug that
pertained to a duplicate pulse when the pulsar commands were invoked
via <code>M-x</code>.  The duplication had the effect of potentially overriding
the color of the pulse such as if, say, <code>pulsar-pulse-line-red</code> was
invoked while the <code>pulsar-face</code> was blue.</li>

<li>Restored several command symbols to the default value of
<code>pulsar-pulse-functions</code>.  Those were disabled to support the use
option <code>pulsar-pulse-on-window-change</code>, but as that is now removed we
revert to the old and more predictable way of handling things.</li>

<li><p>
Introduced conditionality that checks for <code>real-this-command</code>.  This
is necessary for commands that have to fudge <code>this-command</code> to provide
their functionality.  Such is the case with the <code>evil-scroll-up</code> and
<code>evil-scroll-down</code> commands which are internally reported as
<code>previous-line</code> and <code>next-line</code>, respectively.  I discovered this
problem while trying to support Duy Nguyen attempts that making
<code>pulsar</code> work with <code>evil</code>.

Documented how to use pulsar with the <code>next-error-hook</code>.  By default,
the <code>n</code> and <code>p</code> keys in Emacs' compilation buffers (e.g. the results
of a <code>grep</code> search) produce a highlight for the locus of the given
match.  Due to how the code is implemented, we cannot use Pulsar's
standard mechanism to trigger a pulse after the match is highlighted
(i.e. by adding the commands to <code>pulsar-pulse-functions</code>.  Instead,
the user must add this to their configuration:

<li>Refined how Pulsar behaves in the case of the last line.  Basically,
when the last line cannot be highlighted we want to pulse the one
right above.  Thanks to JD Smith for fine-tuning this behaviour in
merge request 1 over at the GitLab mirror:
<a href="https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/pulsar/-/merge_requests/1">https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/pulsar/-/merge_requests/1</a> (exempt
from the requirement to assign copyright to the Free Software
Foundation as it is below the threshold).</li>

<li>Ensured that the Pulsar effect are limited to the current window when
the buffer is displayed in multiple windows.  This avoids the common
problem of simultaneous highlights in multiple locations, which
confuse rather than inform the user of where the point is.  Thanks to
Aymeric Agon-Rambosson for the contribution in merge request 2 over at
the GitLab mirror:
<a href="https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/pulsar/-/merge_requests/2">https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/pulsar/-/merge_requests/2</a>.  Aymeric
has assigned copyright to the Free Software Foundation.</li>

<li>Wrote a buffer-local and a global minor mode that sets up Pulsar.
This supersedes the old design which had a built-in assumption that
the "pulse line" effect should always be global.  Now the user has
more flexibility.  They may also disable Pulsar on demand.  Note that
pulsar still only triggers its effect for entries in the user option
<code>pulsar-pulse-functions</code>.  Thanks to Rudolf Adamkovič for the feedback
in issue 9 over at the GitLab mirror:

<li>Implement the <code>pulsar-highlight-dwim</code> command.  It is like the
<code>pulsar-highlight-line</code> except it also understands regions, be they
regular or rectangular.  Thanks to Mark Barton for the feedback in
issue 13 over at the GitLab mirror:
<a href="https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/pulsar/-/issues/13">https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/pulsar/-/issues/13</a>.</li>

<li>Clarified some technical points in various doc strings and the manual,
such as what is the <code>pulsar-delay</code> and the <code>pulsar-iterations</code>.

<li>Fixed an inconsistency that was present when Emacs was running in a
server-client model where the highlight would never pulse but instead
remain fixed in place until another command was invoked.  By default,
the pulse effect should now work for that use-case.  Thanks to Mark
Barton, Petter Storvik, and user kb for their feedback in issue 1:
<a href="https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/pulsar/-/issues/1">https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/pulsar/-/issues/1</a>.</li>

<li>Implemented the <code>pulsar-highlight-line</code> command and abstracted the
relevant code.  Unlike <code>pulsar-pulse-line</code>, it never pulses the
current line.  Instead it keeps the highlight in place until another
command is invoked.  Thanks to Mark Barton for proposing this in
issue 1.</li>

<li>Introduced the user option <code>pulsar-pulse</code> which determines whether
pulsar should use a pulse effect (notwithstanding the aforementioned
new command).  When its value is non-nil (the default) pulsing takes
place.  Thanks to Petter Storvik for suggesting this approach in
issue 1.</li>

<li>Added the user option <code>pulsar-iterations</code> which controls how smooth or
abrupt the pulse effect is.  This complements the existing variable
<code>pulsar-delay</code>.  Both apply only when <code>pulsar-pulse</code> is non-nil.</li>

<li>Wrote the <code>pulsar-generic</code> face and made it the default value of the
<code>pulsar-face</code> user option.  This is consistent with the original
design of a theme-agnostic presentation, though now it ensures that
the <code>:extend</code> attribute is used to stretch the highlight to the edge
of the window (without it and depending on the theme, the highlight
would only reach the last character on the line).</li>

<li>Updated the manual to reflect those changes.</li>

Initial release of the package.  Please read the manual.
</p>

<p>
The core idea for this package was implemented in the <code>prot-pulse.el</code>
file that is part of <a href="https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles">my dotfiles</a> (now deprecated).  I was using it at
least since December 2020.
