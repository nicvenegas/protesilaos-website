In this 27-minute video I do some work in front of the hut. I am
moving soil, which I will then redistribute to some parts that need to
be reinforced. I am also planting a new walnut tree. While doing this,
I philosophise about the sense of entitlement and the feeling we often
have that we deserve stuff as a reward for our actions. I explain why
I think this is misplaced and how we can be more balanced in our
outlook by taking the world as-is instead of the way we wish it to be.
