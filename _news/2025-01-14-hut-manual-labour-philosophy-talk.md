In this ~46-minute video, I show some of the infrastructure work I am
doing at the back side of the hut. I have been working on this part of
the land for almost a year now, having filled large parts of land with
soil to prevent erosion. In the video I also make several
philosophical points about "small wins", consistency as the key to
reaching long-term goals, freedom and responsibility as two sides of
the same coin, not giving up in the face of difficulty or failure, and
the value of patience.
