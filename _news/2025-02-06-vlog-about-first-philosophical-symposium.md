Yesterday I attended my first philosophical symposium. "Symposium" in
the original Greek sense of "drinking together". The event was held at
a local tavern. I made a brief introduction and then we had an open
discussion that went on until the early morning hours. In this video I
talk about the event and also include the clip I recorded at the
tavern (in Greek).
