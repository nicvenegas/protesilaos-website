title: "Email should be okay, but I also joined Telegram"
excerpt: "I am now also available on the Telegram messaging app as a plan B for my communications."

In the past few days I had technical issues with my email service
provider. I will eventually write a summary of what happened.
Everything should now be in order. I can send and receive messages
reliably, without them mysteriously disappearing into the aether.

Since I already got the Signal app as a plan B for my communications,
I am adding Telegram to the mix: <https://t.me/protesilaos>. I have
updated my contact page accordingly.

Note that I am checking those messaging apps on occasion, but email
remains my preferred medium of communication because of its interoperability.
