In this ~40-minute video I talk about the broad theme of high
performance. This is about doing things at a level of excellence.
There are exceptions you are conforming with and targets you are
meeting. Those may be set externally or by yourself. I explain how we
can get trapped in this world of high performance, by talking about
relatable matters.
